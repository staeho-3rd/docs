This theme has undergone several major iterations, and now it’s fairly stable and full of all the features that I need. You are welcome to use it for your documentation projects for free.\n\nI think this theme does pretty much everything that you can do with something like OxygenXML, but without the constraints of structured authoring. Everything is completely open and changeable, so if you start tinkering around with the theme’s files, you can break things. But it’s completely empowering as well!\n\nWith a completely open architecture and code base, you can modify the code to make it do exactly what you want, without having to jump through all kinds of confusing or proprietary code.\n\nIf there’s a feature you need but it isn’t available here, let me know and I might add it. Alternatively, if you fork the theme, I would love to see your modifications and enhancements. Thanks for using Jekyll."

						"content": "About Ruby\n\nJekyll runs on Ruby, a programming language. You have to have Ruby on your computer in order to run Ruby-based programs like Jekyll. Ruby is installed on the Mac by default, but you must add it to Windows.\n\nAbout Ruby Gems\n\nRuby has a number of plugins referred to as “gems.” Just because you have Ruby doesn’t mean you have all the necessary Ruby gems that your program needs to run. Gems provide additional functionality for Ruby programs. There are thousands of Rubygems available for you to use.\n\nSome gems depend on other gems for functionality. For example, the Jekyll gem might depend on 20 other gems that must also be installed.\n\nEach gem has a version associated with it, and not all gem versions are compatible with each other.\n\nRubygem package managers\n\nBundler is a gem package manager for Ruby, which means it goes out and gets all the gems you need for your Ruby programs. If you tell Bundler you need the jekyll gem, it will retrieve all the dependencies on the jekyll gem as well – automatically.\n\nNot only does Bundler retrieve the right gem dependencies, but it’s smart enough to retrieve the right versions of each gem. For example, if you get the github-pages gem, it will retrieve all of these other gems:\n\ngithub-pages-health-check = 1.1.0\njekyll = 3.0.3\njekyll-coffeescript = 1.0.1\njekyll-feed = 0.4.0\njekyll-gist = 1.4.0\njekyll-github-metadata = 1.9.0\njekyll-mentions = 1.1.2\njekyll-paginate = 1.1.0\njekyll-redirect-from = 0.10.0\njekyll-sass-converter = 1.3.0\njekyll-seo-tag = 1.3.2\njekyll-sitemap = 0.10.0\njekyll-textile-converter = 0.1.0\njemoji = 0.6.2\nkramdown = 1.10.0\nliquid = 3.0.6\nmercenary ~&gt; 0.3\nrdiscount = 2.1.8\nredcarpet = 3.3.3\nRedCloth = 4.2.9\nrouge = 1.10.1\nterminal-table ~&gt; 1.\n\n\nSee how Bundler retrieved version 3.0.3 of the jekyll gem, even though (as of this writing) the latest version of the jekyll gem is 3.1.2? That’s because github-pages is only compatible up to jekyll 3.0.3. Bundler handles all of this dependency and version compatibility for you.\n\nTrying to keep track of which gems and versions are appropriate for your project can be a nightmare. This is the problem Bundler solves. As explained on Bundler.io:\n\n\n  Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.\n\n  Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as bundle install.\n\n\nGemfiles\n\nBundler looks in a project’s “Gemfile” (no file extension) to see which gems are required by the project. The Gemfile lists the source and then any gems, like this:\n\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\n\ngem 'github-pages'\ngem 'jekyll'\n\n\nThe source indicates the site where Bundler will retrieve the gems: https://rubygems.org.\n\nThe gems it retrieves are listed separately on each line.\n\nHere no versions are specified. Sometimes gemfiles will specify the versions like this:\n\ngem 'kramdown', '1.0'\n\n\nThis means Bundler should get version 1.0 of the kramdown gem.\n\nTo specify a subset of versions, the Gemfile looks like this:\n\ngem 'jekyll', '~&gt; 2.3'\n\nThe ~&gt; sign means greater than or equal to the last digit before the last period in the number.\n\nHere it will get any gem equal to 2.3 but less than 3.0.\n\nIf it adds another digit, the scope is affected:\n\ngem `jekyll`, `~&gt;2.3.1'\n\n\nThis means to get any gem equal to 2.3.1 but less than 2.4.\n\nIf it looks like this:\n\ngem 'jekyll', '~&gt; 3.0', '&gt;= 3.0.3'\n\n\nThis will get any Jekyll gem between versions 3.0 and up to 3.0.3.\n\nSee this Stack Overflow post for more details.\n\nGemfile.lock\n\nAfter Bundler retrieves and installs the gems, it makes a detailed list of all the gems and versions it has installed for your project. The snapshot of all gems + versions installed is stored in your Gemfile.lock file, which might look like this:\n\nGEM\n  remote: https://rubygems.org/\n  specs:\n    RedCloth (4.2.9)\n    activesupport (4.2.5.1)\n      i18n (~&gt; 0.7)\n      json (~&gt; 1.7, &gt;= 1.7.7)\n      minitest (~&gt; 5.1)\n      thread_safe (~&gt; 0.3, &gt;= 0.3.4)\n      tzinfo (~&gt; 1.1)\n    addressable (2.3.8)\n    coffee-script (2.4.1)\n      coffee-script-source\n      execjs\n    coffee-script-source (1.10.0)\n    colorator (0.1)\n    ethon (0.8.1)\n      ffi (&gt;= 1.3.0)\n    execjs (2.6.0)\n    faraday (0.9.2)\n      multipart-post (&gt;= 1.2, &lt; 3)\n    ffi (1.9.10)\n    gemoji (2.1.0)\n    github-pages (52)\n      RedCloth (= 4.2.9)\n      github-pages-health-check (= 1.0.1)\n      jekyll (= 3.0.3)\n      jekyll-coffeescript (= 1.0.1)\n      jekyll-feed (= 0.4.0)\n      jekyll-gist (= 1.4.0)\n      jekyll-mentions (= 1.0.1)\n      jekyll-paginate (= 1.1.0)\n      jekyll-redirect-from (= 0.9.1)\n      jekyll-sass-converter (= 1.3.0)\n      jekyll-seo-tag (= 1.3.1)\n      jekyll-sitemap (= 0.10.0)\n      jekyll-textile-converter (= 0.1.0)\n      jemoji (= 0.5.1)\n      kramdown (= 1.9.0)\n      liquid (= 3.0.6)\n      mercenary (~&gt; 0.3)\n      rdiscount (= 2.1.8)\n      redcarpet (= 3.3.3)\n      rouge (= 1.10.1)\n      terminal-table (~&gt; 1.4)\n    github-pages-health-check (1.0.1)\n      addressable (~&gt; 2.3)\n      net-dns (~&gt; 0.8)\n      octokit (~&gt; 4.0)\n      public_suffix (~&gt; 1.4)\n      typhoeus (~&gt; 0.7)\n    html-pipeline (2.3.0)\n      activesupport (&gt;= 2, &lt; 5)\n      nokogiri (&gt;= 1.4)\n    i18n (0.7.0)\n    jekyll (3.0.3)\n      colorator (~&gt; 0.1)\n      jekyll-sass-converter (~&gt; 1.0)\n      jekyll-watch (~&gt; 1.1)\n      kramdown (~&gt; 1.3)\n      liquid (~&gt; 3.0)\n      mercenary (~&gt; 0.3.3)\n      rouge (~&gt; 1.7)\n      safe_yaml (~&gt; 1.0)\n    jekyll-coffeescript (1.0.1)\n      coffee-script (~&gt; 2.2)\n    jekyll-feed (0.4.0)\n    jekyll-gist (1.4.0)\n      octokit (~&gt; 4.2)\n    jekyll-mentions (1.0.1)\n      html-pipeline (~&gt; 2.3)\n      jekyll (~&gt; 3.0)\n    jekyll-paginate (1.1.0)\n    jekyll-redirect-from (0.9.1)\n      jekyll (&gt;= 2.0)\n    jekyll-sass-converter (1.3.0)\n      sass (~&gt; 3.2)\n    jekyll-seo-tag (1.3.1)\n      jekyll (~&gt; 3.0)\n    jekyll-sitemap (0.10.0)\n    jekyll-textile-converter (0.1.0)\n      RedCloth (~&gt; 4.0)\n    jekyll-watch (1.3.1)\n      listen (~&gt; 3.0)\n    jemoji (0.5.1)\n      gemoji (~&gt; 2.0)\n      html-pipeline (~&gt; 2.2)\n      jekyll (&gt;= 2.0)\n    json (1.8.3)\n    kramdown (1.9.0)\n    liquid (3.0.6)\n    listen (3.0.6)\n      rb-fsevent (&gt;= 0.9.3)\n      rb-inotify (&gt;= 0.9.7)\n    mercenary (0.3.5)\n    mini_portile2 (2.0.0)\n    minitest (5.8.4)\n    multipart-post (2.0.0)\n    net-dns (0.8.0)\n    nokogiri (1.6.7.2)\n      mini_portile2 (~&gt; 2.0.0.rc2)\n    octokit (4.2.0)\n      sawyer (~&gt; 0.6.0, &gt;= 0.5.3)\n    public_suffix (1.5.3)\n    rb-fsevent (0.9.7)\n    rb-inotify (0.9.7)\n      ffi (&gt;= 0.5.0)\n    rdiscount (2.1.8)\n    redcarpet (3.3.3)\n    rouge (1.10.1)\n    safe_yaml (1.0.4)\n    sass (3.4.21)\n    sawyer (0.6.0)\n      addressable (~&gt; 2.3.5)\n      faraday (~&gt; 0.8, &lt; 0.10)\n    terminal-table (1.5.2)\n    thread_safe (0.3.5)\n    typhoeus (0.8.0)\n      ethon (&gt;= 0.8.0)\n    tzinfo (1.2.2)\n      thread_safe (~&gt; 0.1)\n\nPLATFORMS\n  ruby\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n  github-pages\n  jekyll\n\nBUNDLED WITH\n   1.11.2\n\n\nYou can always delete the Gemlock file and run Bundle install again to get the latest versions.

						"id": "mydoc-alerts-html",
						"title": "Alerts",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /mydoc_alerts.html",
						"content": "About alerts\n\nAlerts are little warnings, info, or other messages that you have called out in special formatting. In order to use these alerts or callouts, reference the appropriate value stored in the alerts.yml file as described in the following sections.\n\nAlerts\n\nSimilar to inserting images, you insert alerts through various includes that have been developed. These includes provide templates through which you pass parameters to easily populate the right HTML code.\n\n{% include note.html content=\"This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.\" %}\n\n\nHere’s the result:\n\n Note: This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.\n\nWith alerts, there’s just one include property:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Property\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      content\n      The content for the alert.\n    \n  \n\n\nUsing block level tags inside the alerts\n\nIf you need multiple paragraphs, enter &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; tags. This is because block level tags aren’t allowed here, as Kramdown is processing the content as Markdown despite the fact that the content is surrounded by HTML tags. Here’s an example with a break:\n\n{% include note.html content=\"This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Now I'm typing on a  new line.\" %}\n\n\nHere’s the result:\n\n Note: This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.  Now I’m typing on a new line.\n\nThe include uses markdown=\"span\" as an attribute, which means kramdown will process the entire content as a span. You can’t use block elements such as p or div or pre. If you need these elements, you can either manually surround the content with the HTML from the include, or you can use these tags:\n\n{{site.data.alerts.note}}\n&lt;p&gt;This is my note.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\ndef foo(x):&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;return x+1\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n{{site.data.alerts.end}}\n\n\nResult:\n\n Note: \nThis is my note.\n\ndef foo(x):\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return x+1\n\n\n\nThe same Bootstrap code from the alert is stored in yaml files inside the _data folder. (This was how I previously implemented this code, but since this method was prone to error and didn’t trigger any build warnings or failures when incorrectly coded, I changed the approach to use includes instead.)\n\nTypes of alerts available\n\nThere are four types of alerts you can leverage:\n\n\n  note.html\n  tip.html\n  warning.html\n  important.html\n\n\nThey function the same except they have a different color, icon, and alert word. You include the different types by selecting the include template you want. Here are samples of each alert:\n\n Note: This is my note.\n\n Tip: This is my tip.\n\n Warning: This is my warning.\n\n Important: This is my important info.\n\nThese alerts leverage includes stored in the _include folder. The content option is a parameter that you pass to the include. In the include, the parameter is passed like this:\n\n&lt;div markdown=\"span\" class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; {{include.content}}&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nThe content in content=\"This is my note.\" gets inserted into the {{include.content}}} part of the template. You can follow this same pattern to build additional includes. See this Jekyll screencast on includes or this screencast for more information.\n\nCallouts\n\nThere’s another type of callout available called callouts. This format is typically used for longer callout that spans more than one or two paragraphs, but really it’s just a stylistic preference whether to use an alert or callout.\n\nHere’s the syntax for a callout:\n\n{% include callout.html content=\"This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. \" type=\"primary\" %} \n\n\nHere’s the result:\n\nThis is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs.\n\nThe available properties for callouts are as follows:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Property\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      content\n      The content for the callout.\n    \n    \n      type\n      The style for the callout. Options are danger, default, primary, success, info, and warning.\n    \n  \n\n\nThe types just define the color of the left border. Each of these callout types get inserted as a class name in the callout template. These class names correspond with styles in Bootstrap. These classes are common Bootstrap class names whose style attributes differ depending on your Bootstrap theme and style definitions.\n\nHere’s an example of each different type of callout:\n\nThis is my danger type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.\n\nThis is my default type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.\n\nThis is my primary type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.\n\nThis is my success type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.\n\nThis is my info type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.\n\nThis is my warning type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.\n\nNow that in contrast to alerts, callouts don’t include the alert word (note, tip, warning, or important). You have to manually include it inside content if you want it.\n\nTo include paragraph breaks, use &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; inside the callout:\n\n{% include callout.html content=\"**Important information**: This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here I am starting a new paragraph, because I have lots of information to share. You may wonder why I'm using line breaks instead of paragraph tags. This is because Kramdown processes the Markdown here as a span rather than a div (for whatever reason). Be grateful that you can be using Markdown at all inside of HTML. That's usually not allowed in Markdown syntax, but it's allowed here.\" type=\"primary\" %} \n\n\nHere’s the result:\n\nImportant information: This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. Here I am starting a new paragraph, because I have lots of information to share. You may wonder why I’m using line breaks instead of paragraph tags. This is because Kramdown processes the Markdown here as a span rather than a div (for whatever reason). Be grateful that you can be using Markdown at all inside of HTML. That’s usually not allowed in Markdown syntax, but it’s allowed here.\n\nUse Liquid variables inside parameters with includes\n\nSuppose you have a product name or some other property that you’re storing as a variable in your configuration file (_config.yml), and you want to use this variable in the content parameter for your alert or callout. You will get an error if you use Liquid syntax inside a include parameter. For example, this syntax will produce an error:\n\n{% include note.html content=\"The {{site.company}} is pleased to announce an upcoming release.\" %}\n\n\nThe error will say something like this:\n\nLiquid Exception: Invalid syntax for include tag. File contains invalid characters or sequences: ... Valid syntax: {% include file.ext param='value' param2='value' %}\n\n\nTo use variables in your include parameters, you must use the “variable parameter” approach. First you use a capture tag to capture some content. Then you reference this captured tag in your include. Here’s an example.\n\nIn my site configuration file (_congfig.yml), I have a property called company_name.\n\ncompany_name: Your company\n\n\nI want to use this variable in my note include.\n\nFirst, before the note I capture the content for my note’s include like this:\n\n{% capture company_note %}The {{site.company_name}} company is pleased to announce an upcoming release.{% endcapture %}\n\n\nNow reference the company_note in your include parameter like this:\n\n{% include note.html content=company_note}\n\n\nHere’s the result:\n\n Note: The Copyright 3RDEYESYSTEM Corp is pleased to announce an upcoming release.\n\nNote the omission of quotation marks with variable parameters.\n\nAlso note that instead of storing the variable in your site’s configuration file, you could also put the variable in your page’s frontmatter. Then instead of using {{site.company_name}} you would use {{page.company_name}}.\n\nMarkdown inside of callouts and alerts\n\nYou can use Markdown inside of callouts and alerts, even though this content actually gets inserted inside of HTML in the include. This is one of the advantages of kramdown Markdown. The include template has an attribute of markdown=\"span\" that allows for the processor to parse Markdown inside of HTML.\n\nValidity checking\n\nIf you have some of the syntax wrong with an alert or callout, you’ll see an error when Jekyll tries to build your site. The error may look like this:\n\nLiquid Exception: Invalid syntax for include tag: content=\"This is my **info** type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. type=\"info\" Valid syntax: {% include file.ext param='value' param2='value' %} in mydoc/mydoc_alerts.md \n\n\nThese errors are a good thing, because it lets you know there’s an error in your syntax. Without the errors, you may not realize that you coded something incorrectly until you see the lack of alert or callout styling in your output.\n\nIn this case, the quotation marks aren’t set correctly. I forgot the closing quotation mark for the content parameter include.\n\nBlast a warning to users on every page\n\nIf you want to blast a warning to users on every page, add the alert or callout to the _layouts/page.html page right below the frontmatter. Every page using the page layout (all, by default) will show this message."

						"content": "How to build Jekyll sites\n\nThe normal way to build the Jekyll site is through the build command:\n\njekyll build\n\n\nTo build the site and view it in a live server so that Jekyll rebuilds that site each time you make a change, use the serve command:\n\njekyll serve\n\n\nBy default, the _config.yml in the root directory will be used, Jekyll will scan the current directory for files, and the folder _site will be used as the output. You can customize these build commands like this:\n\njekyll serve --config configs/myspecialconfig.yml --destination ../doc_outputs\n\n\nHere the configs/myspecialconfig.yml file is used instead of _config.yml. The destination directory is ../doc_outputs, which would be one level up from your current directory.\n\nShortcuts for the build arguments\n\nIf you have a long build argument and don’t want to enter it every time in Jekyll, noting all your configuration details, you can create a shell script and then just run the script. Simply put the build argument into a text file and save it with the .sh extension (for Mac) or .bat extension (for Windows). Then run it like this:\n\n. myscript.sh\n\n\nMy preference is to add the scripts to profiles in iTerm. See iTerm Profiles for more details.\n\nStop a server\n\nWhen you’re done with the preview server, press Ctrl+C to exit out of it. If you exit iTerm or Terminal without shutting down the server, the next time you build your site, or if you build multiple sites with the same port, you may get a server-already-in-use message.\n\nYou can kill the server process using these commands:\n\nps aux | grep jekyll\n\n\nFind the PID (for example, it  looks like “22298”).\n\nThen type kill -9 22298 where “22298” is the PID.\n\nTo kill all Jekyll instances, use this:\n\nkill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')\n\n\nI recommend creating a profile in iTerm that stores this command. Here’s what the iTerm settings look like:\n\niTerm profile settings to kill all Jekyll"

Configure the build scripts\n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nAbout the build scripts\n\nThe mydoc project has 5 build scripts and a script that runs them all. These scripts will require a bit of detail to configure. Every team member who is publishing on the project should set up their folder structure in the way described here.\n\nGet Set Up\n\nYour command-line terminal opens up to your user name (for example, Users/tjohnson). I like to put all of my projects from repositories into a subfolder under my username called “projects.” This makes it easy to get to the projects from the command line. You can vary from the project organization I describe here, but following the pattern I outline will make configuration easier.\n\nTo set up your projects:\n\n\n  Set up your Jekyll theme in a folder called “docs.” All of the source files for every project the team is working on should live in this directory. Most likely you already either downloaded or cloned the jekyll-documentation-theme. Just rename the folder to “docs” and move it into the projects folder as shown here.\n  \n    In the same root directory where the docs folder is, create another directory parallel to docs called doc_outputs. \n\n    Thus, your folder structure should be something like this:\n\n    projects\n- docs\n- doc_outputs\n    \n\n    The docs folder contains the source of all your files, while the doc_outputs contains the site outputs.\n  \n\n\nConfigure the Build Scripts\n\nFor the mydocs project, you’ll see a series of build scripts for each project. There are 5 build scripts, described in the following sections. Note that you really only need to run the last one, e.g., mydoc_all.sh, because it runs all of the build scripts. But you have to make sure each script is correctly configured so that they all build successfully.\n\n Tip: In the descriptions of the build scripts, “mydoc” is used as the sample project. Substitute in whatever your real project name is.\n\nmydoc_1_multiserve_pdf.sh\n\nHere’s what this script looks like:\n\necho 'Killing all Jekyll instances'\nkill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')\nclear\n\n\necho \"Building PDF-friendly HTML site for Mydoc Writers ...\"\njekyll serve --detach --config configs/mydoc/config_writers.yml,configs/mydoc/config_writers_pdf.yml\necho \"done\"\n\necho \"Building PDF-friendly HTML site for Mydoc Designers ...\"\njekyll serve --detach --config configs/mydoc/config_designers.yml,configs/mydoc/config_designers_pdf.yml\necho \"done\"\n\necho \"All done serving up the PDF-friendly sites. Now let's generate the PDF files from these sites.\"\necho \"Now run . mydoc_2_multibuild_pdf.sh\"\n\n\nAfter killing all existing Jekyll instances that may be running, this script serves up a PDF friendly version of the docs (in HTML format) at the destination specified in the configuration file.\n\nEach of your configuration files needs to have a destination like this: ../doc_outputs/mydoc/adtruth-java. That is, the project should build in the doc_outputs folder, in a subfolder that matches the project name.\n\nThe purpose of this script is to make a version of the HTML output that is friendly to the Prince XML PDF generator. This version of the output strips out the sidebar, topnav, and other components to just render a bare-bones HTML representation of the content.\n\nCustomize the script with your own PDF configuration file names.\n\nmydoc_2_multibuild_pdf.sh\n\nHere’s what this script looks like:\n\n# Doc Writers\necho \"Building the Mydoc Writers PDF ...\"\nprince --javascript --input-list=../doc_outputs/mydoc/writers-pdf/prince-file-list.txt -o mydoc/files/mydoc_writers_pdf.pdf;\necho \"done\"\n\n# Doc Designers\necho \"Building Mydoc Designers PDF ...\"\nprince --javascript --input-list=../doc_outputs/mydoc/designers-pdf/prince-file-list.txt -o mydoc/files/mydoc_designers_pdf.pdf;\necho \"done\"\n\necho \"All done building the PDFs!\"\necho \"Now build the web outputs: . mydoc_3_multibuild_web.sh\"\n\n\nThis script builds the PDF output using the Prince command. The script reads the location of the prince-file-list.txt file in the PDF friendly output folder (as defined in the previous script) and builds a PDF.\n\nThe Prince build command takes an input parameter (--input-list=) that lists where all the pages are (prince-file-list.txt), and then combines all the pages into a PDF, including cross-references and other details. The Prince build command also specifies the output folder (-o).\n\nThe prince-file-list.txt file (which simply contains a list of URLs to HTML pages) is generated by iterating through the table of contents (mydoc_sidebar.yml) and creating a list of URLs. You can open up prince-file-list.txt in the doc output to ensure that it has a list of absolute URLs (not relative) in order for Prince to build the PDF.\n\nThis is one way the configuration file for the PDF-friendly output differs from the HTML output. (If the PDF isn’t building, it’s because the prince-file-list.txt in the output is empty or it contains relative URLs.)\n\nThe Prince build script puts the output PDF into the mydoc/mydoc/files directory. Now you can reference the PDF file in your HTML site. For example, on the homepage you can allow people to download a PDF of the content at files/adtruth_dotnet_pdf.pdf.\n\nmydoc_3_multibuild_web.sh\n\nHere’s what this script looks like:\n\nkill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')\nclear\n\necho \"Building Mydoc Writers website...\"\njekyll build --config configs/doc/config_writers.yml\n# jekyll serve --config configs/doc/config_writers.yml\necho \"done\"\n\necho \"Building Mydoc Designers website...\"\njekyll build --config configs/doc/config_designers.yml\n# jekyll serve --config configs/doc/config_designers.yml\necho \"done\"\n\necho \"All finished building all the web outputs!!!\"\necho \"Now push the builds to the server with . mydoc_4_publish.sh\"\n\n\nAfter killing all Jekyll instances, this script builds an HTML version of the projects and puts the output into the doc_outputs folder. This is the version of the content that users will mainly navigate. Since the sites are built with relative links, you can browse to the folder on your local machine, double-click the index.html file, and see the site.\n\nThe # part below the jekyll build commands contains a serve command that is there for mere convenience in case you want to serve up just one site among many that you’re building. For example, if you don’t want to build everything — just one site — you might just use the serve command instead. (Anything after # in a YAML file comments out the content.)\n\nmydoc_4_publish.sh\n\nHere’s what this script looks like:\n\necho \"remove previous directory and any subdirectories without a warning prompt\"\nssh yourusername@yourdomain.com 'rm -rf /var/www/html/yourpublishingdirectory'\n\necho \"push new content into the remote directory\"\nscp -r -vrC ../mydoc_outputs/doc-writers yourusername@yourdomain:/var/www/html/yourpublishingdirectory\n\necho \"All done pushing doc outputs to the server\"\n\n\n\nThis script assumes you’re publishing content onto a Linux server.\n\nChange yourusername to your own user name.\n\nThis script first removes the project folder on /var/www/html/yourpublishingdirectory site and then transfers the content from doc_outputs over to the appropriate folder in /var/www/html/yourpublishingdirectory.\n\nNote that the delete part of the script (rm -rf) works really well. It annihilates a folder in a heartbeat and doesn’t give you any warning prompts, so make sure you have it set up correctly.\n\nAlso, in case you haven’t set up the SSH publishing without a password, see [Getting around the password prompts in SCP][mydoc_no_password_prompts_scp]. Otherwise the script will stop and ping you to enter your password for each directory it transfers.\n\n(Optional) Push to repositories\n\nThis script isn’t included in the theme, but you might optionally decide to push the built sites into another github repository. For example, if you’re using Cloud Cannon to deploy your sites, you can have Cloud Cannon read files from a specific Github repository.\n\nHere’s what this script looks like:\n\ncd doc_outputs/mydoc/designers\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"publishing latest version of docs\"\ngit push\necho \"All done pushing to Github\"\necho \"Here's the link to download the guides...\"\ncd ../../docs\n\n\nThis final script simply makes a commit into a Github repo for one of your outputs.\n\nThe doc_outputs/mydoc/designers contains the site output from mydoc, so when you push content from this folder into Github, you’re actually pushing the HTML site output into Github, not the mydoc source files.\n\nYour delivery team can also grab the site output from these repos. After downloading it, the person unzips the folder and sees the website folders inside.\n\nmydoc_all.sh\n\nHere’s what this script looks like:\n\n. deviceinsight_1_multiserve_pdf.sh; . deviceinsight_2_multibuild_pdf.sh; . deviceinsight_3_multibuild_web.sh; . deviceinsight_4_publish.sh;\n\n\nThis script simply runs the other scripts. To sequence the commands, you just separate them with semicolons. (If you added the optional script, be sure to include it here.)\n\nAfter you’ve configured all the scripts, you can run them all by running . mydoc_all.sh. You might want to run this script at lunchtime, since it may take about 10 to 20 minutes to completely build the scripts. But note that since everything is now automated, you don’t have to do anything at all after executing the script. After the script finishes, everything is published and in the right location.\n\nTest out the scripts\n\nAfter setting up and customizing the build scripts, run a few tests to make sure everything is generating correctly. Getting this part right is somewhat difficult and may likely require you to tinker around with the scripts a while before it works flawlessly."

You might create a collection if you want to treat a specific set of articles in a unique way, such as with a custom layout or listing. For more detail on collections, see Ben Balter’s explanation of collections here.\n\nCreate a collection\nTo create a collection, add the following in your configuration file:\n\ncollections:\n  tooltips:\n    output: true\n\n\nIn this example, “tooltips”” is the name of the collection.\n\nInteracting with collections\n\nYou can interact with collections by using the site.collectionname namespace, where collectionname is what you’ve configured. In this case, if I wanted to loop through all tooltips, I would use site.tooltips instead of site.pages or site.posts.\n\nSee Collections in the Jekyll documentation for more information.\n\nHow to use collections\n\nI haven’t found a huge use for collections in normal documentation. However, I did find a use for collections in generating a tooltip file that would be used for delivering tooltips to a user interface from text files in the documentation. See Help APIs and UI tooltips for details.\n\nVideo tutorial on collections\n\nSee this video tutorial on Jekyll.tips for more details on collections."

						"content": "About the review process\n\nIf you’re using the doc as code approach, you might also consider using the same techniques for reviewing the doc as people use in reviewing code. This approach will involve using Github to edit the files.\n\nThere’s an Edit me button on each page on this theme. This button allows collaborators to edit the content on Github.\n\nHere’s the code for that button on the page.html layout for GitHub:\n\n{% if site.github_editme_path %}\n\n&lt;a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/{{site.github_editme_path}}/{{page.folder}}{{page.url | append: \".md\"}}{% endif %}\" class=\"btn btn-default githubEditButton\" role=\"button\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-github fa-lg\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Edit me&lt;/a&gt;\n\n{% endif %}\n\n\nand here for GitLab:\n\n{% if site.gitlab_editme_path %}\n\n&lt;a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/{{site.gitlab_editme_path}}/{{page.folder}}{{page.url | append: \".md\"}}{% endif %}\" class=\"btn btn-default githubEditButton\" role=\"button\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-gitlab fa-lg\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Edit me&lt;/a&gt;\n\n{% endif %}\n\n\nIn your configuration file, edit the value for github_editme_path (or for Gitlab: gitlab_editme_path). For example, you might create a branch called “reviews” on your Github repo. Then you would add something like this in your configuration file for the ‘github_editme_path’: tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll/edit/reviews. Here “tomjoht” is my github account name. The repo name is “documentation-theme-jekyll”. The “reviews” name is the branch.\n\nTo suppress this button, comment out the github_editme_path in the _config.yml file.\n\nAdd reviewers as collaborators\n\nIf you want people to collaborate on your project so that their edits get committed to a branch on your project, you need to add them as collaborators. For your Github repo, click Settings and add the collaborators on the Collaborators tab using their Github usernames.\n\nIf you don’t want to allow anyone to commit to your Github branch, don’t add the reviewers as collaborators. When someone makes an edit, Github will fork the theme. The person’s edit then will appear as a pull request to your repo. You can then choose to merge the change indicated in the pull or not.\n\n Note: When you process pull requests, you have to accept everything or nothing. You can’t pick and choose which changes you’ll merge. Therefore you’ll probably want to edit the branch you’re planning to merge or ask the contributor to make some changes to the fork before processing the pull request.\n\nWorkflow\n\nUsers will make edits in your “reviews” branch (or whatever you want to call it). You can then commit those edits as you make updates.\n\nWhen you’re finished making all updates in the branch, you can merge the branch into the master.\n\nNote that if you’re making updates online, those updates will be out of sync with any local edits.\n\n Warning: Don’t make edits both online using Github’s browser-based interface AND offline on your local machine using your local tools. When you try to push from your local, you’ll likely get a merge conflict error. Instead, make sure you do a pull and update on your local after making any edits online.\n\nProse.io\n\nProse.io is an overlay on Github that would allow people to make comments in an easier interface. If you simply go to prose.io, it asks to authorize your Github account, and so it will read files directly from Github but in the Prose.io interface."

						"content": "About Liquid and conditional statements\nIf you want to create different outputs for different audiences, you can do all of this using a combination of Jekyll’s Liquid markup and values in your configuration file. This is how I previously configured the theme. I had different configuration files for each output. Each configuration file specified different values for product, audience, version, and so on. Then I had different build processes that would leverage the different configuration files. It seemed like a perfect implementation of DITA-like techniques with Jekyll.\n\nBut I soon found that having lots of separate outputs for a project was undesirable. If you have 10 different outputs that have different nuances for different audiences, it’s hard to manage and maintain. In this latest version of the theme, I consolidated all information into the same output to explicitly do away with the multi-output approach.\n\nAs such, the conditional logic won’t have as much play as it previously did. Instead of conditions, you’ll probably want to incorporate navtabs to split up the information.\n\nHowever, you can still of course use conditional logic as needed.\n\n Tip: Definitely check out Liquid’s documentation for more details about how to use operators and other liquid markup. The notes here are a small, somewhat superficial sample from the site.\n\nWhere to store filtering values\n\nYou can filter content based on values that you have set either in your page’s frontmatter, a config file, or in a file in your _data folder. If you set the attribute in your config file, you need to restart the Jekyll server to see the changes. If you set the value in a file in your _data folder or page frontmatter, you don’t need to restart the server when you make changes.\n\nConditional logic based on config file value\n\nHere’s an example of conditional logic based on a value in the page’s frontmatter. Suppose you have the following in your frontmatter:\n\nplatform: mac\n\n\nOn a page in my site (it can be HTML or markdown), you can conditionalize content using the following:\n\n{% if page.platform == \"mac\" %}\nHere's some info about the Mac.\n{% elsif page.platform == \"windows\" %}\nHere's some info about Windows ...\n{% endif %}\n\n\nThis uses simple if-elsif logic to determine what is shown (note the spelling of elsif). The else statement handles all other conditions not handled by the if statements.\n\nHere’s an example of if-else logic inside a list:\n\nTo bake a casserole:\n\n1. Gather the ingredients.\n{% if page.audience == \"writer\" %}\n2. Add in a pound of meat.\n{% elsif page.audience == \"designer\" %}\n3. Add in an extra can of beans.\n{% endif %}\n3. Bake in oven for 45 min.\n\n\nYou don’t need the elsif or else. You could just use an if (but be sure to close it with endif).\n\nOr operator\n\nYou can use more advanced Liquid markup for conditional logic, such as an or command. See Shopify’s Liquid documentation for more details.\n\nFor example, here’s an example using or:\n\n{% if page.audience contains \"vegan\" or page.audience == \"vegetarian\" %}\n    Then run this...\n{% endif %}\n\n\nNote that you have to specify the full condition each time. You can’t shorten the above logic to the following:\n\n{% if page.audience contains \"vegan\" or \"vegetarian\" %}\n    // run this.\n{% endif %}\n\n\nThis won’t work.\n\nUnless operator\n\nYou can also use unless in your logic, like this:\n\n{% unless site.output == \"pdf\" %}\n...do this\n{% endunless %}\n\n\nWhen figuring out this logic, read it like this: “Run the code here unless this condition is satisfied.”.”\n\nDon’t read it the other way around or you’ll get confused. (It’s not executing the code only if the condition is satisfied.)\n\nStoring conditions in the _data folder\n\nHere’s an example of using conditional logic based on a value in a data file:\n\n{% if site.data.options.output == \"alpha\" %}\nshow this content...\n{% elsif site.data.options.output == \"beta\" %}\nshow this content...\n{% else %}\nthis shows if neither of the above two if conditions are met.\n{% endif %}\n\n\nTo use this, I would need to have a _data folder called options where the output property is stored.\n\nSpecifying the location for _data\n\nYou can also specify a data_source for your data location in your configuration file. Then you aren’t limited to simply using _data to store your data files.\n\nFor example, suppose you have 2 projects: alpha and beta. You might store all the data files for alpha inside data_alpha, and all the data files for beta inside data_beta.\n\nIn your alpha configuration file, specify the data source like this:\n\ndata_source: data_alpha\n\n\nThen create a folder called _data_alpha.\n\nFor your beta configuration file, specify the data source like this:\n\ndata_source: data_beta\n\n\nThen create a folder called _data_beta.\n\nConditions versus includes\n\nIf you have a lot of conditions in your text, it can get confusing. As a best practice, whenever you insert an if condition, add the endif at the same time. This will reduce the chances of forgetting to close the if statement. Jekyll won’t build if there are problems with the liquid logic.\n\nIf your text is getting busy with a lot of conditional statements, consider putting a lot of content into includes so that you can more easily see where the conditions begin and end."

Put the file containing content you want to reuse (e.g., mypage.html) inside the _includes/custom folder and then use a tag like this:\n\n{% include custom/mypage.html %}\n\n\nWith content in your _includes folder, you don’t add any frontmatter to these pages because they will be included on other pages already containing frontmatter.\n\nAlso, when you include a file, all of the file’s contents get included. You can’t specify that you only want a specific part of the file included. However, you can use parameters with includes.\n\nSee the following Jekyll cast for more info about using parameters with includes:\n\n\n\nPage-level variables\n\nYou can also create custom variables in your frontmatter like this:\n\n---\ntitle: Page-level variables\npermalink: page_level_variables/\nthing1: Joe\nthing2: Dave\n---\n\n\nYou can then access the values in those custom variables using the page namespace, like this:\n\nthing1: {{page.thing1}}\nthing2: {{page.thing2}}\n\n\nI use includes all the time. Most of the includes in the _includes directory are pulled into the theme layouts. For those includes that change, I put them inside custom and then inside a specific project folder."

						"url": " /mydoc_exluding_files.html",
						"content": "About exclusion\nBy default, all files in your project are included in your output (regardless of whether they’re listed in the sidebar_doc.yml file or not). To exclude files, note them in the exclude section in the configuration file. Here’s a sample:\n\n\nexclude:\n  - mydoc_writers_*\n  - bower_components\n  - Gemfile\n\n\nIf you have different outputs for your site, you’ll want to customize the exclude sections in your various configuration files.\n\nExclude strategies\nHere’s the process I recommend. Put all files in the root directory of your project. Suppose one project’s name is alpha and the other is beta. Then name each file as follows:\n\n\n  alpha_sample.html\n  beta_sample.html\n\n\nIn your exclude list for your beta project, specify it as follows:\n\nexclude:\n- alpha_*\n\n\nIn your exclude list for your alpha project, specify it as follows:\n\nexclude:\n- beta_*\n\n\nIf you have more sophisticated exclusion, add another level to your file names. For example, if you have different programming languages you want to filter by, add this:\n\n\n  alpha_java_sample.html\n  alpha_cpp_sample.html\n\n\nThen you exclude files for your Alpha C++ project as follows:\n\nexclude:\n\n- alpha_java_*\n- beta_*\n\n\nAnd you exclude files for your Alpha Java project as follows:\n\nexclude:\n\n- alpha_cpp_*\n- alpha_beta_*\n\n\nWhen you exclude folders, include the trailing slash at the end of the folder name:\n\nexclude:\n- images/alpha/\n\n\nThere isn’t a way to automatically exclude anything. By default, everything is included unless you explicitly list it under the exclude section.\n\nExcluding draft content\n\nIf you’re working on a draft, put it inside the _drafts folder or add published: false in the frontmatter. The _drafts folder is excluded by default, so you don’t have to specify it in your exclude list.\n\nLimitations\n\nWhat if a file should appear in two projects but not the third? This can get tricky. For some files, rather than using a wildcard, you may need to manually specify the entire filename that you’re excluding instead of excluding it by way of a wildcard pattern."

						"content": "PDF overview\nThis process for creating a PDF relies on Prince XML to transform the HTML content into PDF. Prince costs about $500 per license. That might seem like a lot, but if you’re creating a PDF, you’re probably working for a company that sells a product, so you likely have access to some resources. There’s also a free license that prints a small “P” watermark on your title page, so if you’re fine with that, great.\n\nThe basic approach is to generate a list of all web pages that need to be added to the PDF, and then add leverage Prince to package them up into a PDF. Once you set it up, building a pdf is just a matter of running a couple of commands. Also, creating a PDF this way gives you a lot more control and customization capabilities than with other methods for creating PDFs. If you know CSS, you can entirely customize the output.\n\nDemo\n\nYou can see an example of the finished product here:\n\n PDF Download\n\nTo generate the PDF, browse to the theme’s directory in your terminal and run this script:\n\n. pdf-mydoc.sh\n\n\nThis builds a PDF for the documentation in the theme. Look in the pdf folder for the output, and see the “last generated date” to confirm that you generated the PDF.\n\nTo build a PDF for the other sample projects, run these commands:\n\n. pdf-product1.sh\n\n\nor\n\n. pdf-product2.sh\n\n\nYou can see the details of the script in these files in the theme’s root directory. For example, open pdf-mydoc.sh. It contains the following:\n\n# Note that .sh scripts work only on Mac. If you're on Windows, install Git Bash and use that as your client.\n\necho 'Kill all Jekyll instances'\nkill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')\nclear\n\necho \"Building PDF-friendly HTML site for Mydoc ...\";\nbundle exec jekyll serve --detach --config _config.yml,pdfconfigs/config_mydoc_pdf.yml;\necho \"done\";\n\necho \"Building the PDF ...\";\nprince --javascript --input-list=_site/pdfconfigs/prince-list.txt -o pdf/mydoc.pdf;\n\necho \"Done. Look in the pdf directory to see if it printed successfully.\"\n\n\nAfter stopping all Jekyll instances, we build Jekyll using a special configuration file that specifies a unique stylesheet. The build contains a file (prince-list.txt) that contains a list of all pages to be included in the PDF. We feed this list into a Prince command to build the PDF.\n\nThe following sections explain more about the setup.\n\n1. Set up Prince\n\nDownload and install Prince.\n\nYou can install a fully functional trial version. The only difference is that the title page will have a small Prince PDF watermark.\n\n2. Create a new configuration file for each of your PDF targets\n\nThe PDF configuration file will build on the settings in the regular configuration file but will some additional fields. Here’s the configuration file for the mydoc product within this theme. This configuration file is located in the pdfconfigs folder.\n\ndestination: _site/\nurl: \"http://127.0.0.1:4010\"\nbaseurl: \"/mydoc-pdf\"\nport: 4010\noutput: pdf\nproduct: mydoc\nprint_title: Jekyll theme for documentation — mydoc product\nprint_subtitle: version 5.0\noutput: pdf\ndefaults:\n  -\n    scope:\n      path: \"\"\n      type: \"pages\"\n    values:\n      layout: \"page_print\"\n      comments: true\n      search: true\n\npdf_sidebar: mydoc_sidebar\n\n\n Note: Although you’re creating a PDF, you must still build an HTML web target before running Prince. Prince will pull from the HTML files and from the file-list for the TOC.\n\nNote that the default page layout specified by this configuration file is page_print. This layout strips out all the sections that shouldn’t appear in the print PDF, such as the sidebar and top navigation bar.\n\nAlso note that there’s a output: pdf property in case you want to make some of your content unique to PDF output. For example, you could add conditional logic that checks whether site.output is pdf or web. If it’s pdf, then include information only for the PDF, and so on. If you’re using nav tabs, you’ll definitely want to create an alternative experience in the PDF.\n\nIn the configuration file, customize the values for the print_title and print_subtitle that you want. These will appear on the title page of the PDF.\n\nWe will access this configure file in the PDF generation script.\n\n3. Make sure your sidebar data file has titlepage.html and tocpage.html entries\n\nThere are two template pages in the root directory that are critical to the PDF:\n\n\n  titlepage.html\n  tocpage.html\n\n\nThese pages should appear in your sidebar YML file (in this product, mydoc_sidebar.yml):\n\n- title:\n  output: pdf\n  type: frontmatter\n  folderitems:\n  - title:\n    url: /titlepage.html\n    output: pdf\n    type: frontmatter\n  - title:\n    url: /tocpage.html\n    output: pdf\n    type: frontmatter\n\n\nLeave these pages here in your sidebar. (The output: pdf property means they won’t appear in your online TOC because the conditional logic of the sidebar.html checks whether web is equal to pdf or not before including the item in the web version of the content.)\n\nThe code in the tocpage.html is mostly identical to that of the sidebar.html page. This is essential for Prince to create the page numbers correctly with cross references.\n\nThere’s another file (in the root directory of the theme) that is critical to the PDF generation process: prince-list.txt. This file simply iterates through the items in your sidebar and creates a list of links. Prince will consume the list of links from prince-list.txt and create a running PDF that contains all of the pages listed, with appropriate cross references and styling for them all.\n\n Note: If you have any files that you do not want to appear in the PDF, add output: web (rather than output: pdf) in the list of attributes in your sidebar. The prince-list.txt file that loops through the mydoc_sidebar.yml file to grab the URLs of each page that should appear in the PDF will skip over any items that do not list output: pdf in the item attributes. For example, you might not want your tag archives to appear in the PDF, but you probably will want to list them in the online help navigation.\n\n4. Customize your headers and footers\n\nOpen up the css/printstyles.css file and customize what you want for the headers and footers. At the very least, customize the email address (youremail@domain.com) that appears in the bottom left.\n\nExactly how the print styling works here is pretty nifty. You don’t need to understand the rest of the content in this section unless you want to customize your PDFs to look different from what I’ve configured. But I’m adding this information here in case you want to understand how to customize the look and feel of the PDF output.\n\nThis style creates a page reference for a link:\n\na[href]::after {\n    content: \" (page \" target-counter(attr(href), page) \")\"\n}\n\n\nYou don’t want cross references for any link that doesn’t reference another page, so this style specifies that the content after should be blank:\n\na[href*=\"mailto\"]::after, a[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]::after, a[href].noCrossRef::after {\n    content: \"\";\n}\n\n\n Tip: If you have a link to a file download, or some other link that shouldn’t have a cross reference (such as link used in JavaScript for navtabs or collapsible sections, for example, add noCrossRef as a class to the link to avoid having it say “page 0” in the cross reference.\n\nThis style specifies that after links to web resources, the URL should be inserted instead of the page number:\n\na[href^=\"http:\"]::after, a[href^=\"https:\"]::after {\n    content: \" (\" attr(href) \")\";\n}\n\n\nThis style sets the page margins:\n\n@page {\n    margin: 60pt 90pt 60pt 90pt;\n    font-family: sans-serif;\n    font-style:none;\n    color: gray;\n\n}\n\n\nTo set a specific style property for a particular page, you have to name the page. This allows Prince to identify the page.\n\nFirst you add frontmatter to the page that specifies the type. For the titlepage.html, here’s the frontmatter:\n\n---\ntype: title\n---\n\n\nFor the tocpage, here’s the frontmatter:\n\n---\ntype: frontmatter\n---\n\n\nFor the index.html page, we have this type tag (among others):\n\n---\ntype: first_page\n---\n\n\nThe default_print.html layout will change the class of the body element based on the type value in the page’s frontmatter:\n\n&lt;body class=\"{% if page.type == \"title\"%}title{% elsif page.type == \"frontmatter\" %}frontmatter{% elsif page.type == \"first_page\" %}first_page{% endif %} print\"&gt;\n\n\nNow in the css/printstyles.css file, you can assign a page name based on a specific class:\n\nbody.title { page: title }\n\n\nThis means that for content inside of body class=\"title\", we can style this page in our stylesheet using @page title.\n\nHere’s how that title page is styled:\n\n@page title {\n    @top-left {\n        content: \" \";\n    }\n    @top-right {\n        content: \" \"\n    }\n    @bottom-right {\n        content: \" \";\n    }\n    @bottom-left {\n        content: \" \";\n    }\n}\n\n\nAs you can see, we don’t have any header or footer content, because it’s the title page.\n\nFor the tocpage.html, which has the type: frontmatter, this is specified in the stylesheet:\n\nbody.frontmatter { page: frontmatter }\nbody.frontmatter {counter-reset: page 1}\n\n\n@page frontmatter {\n    @top-left {\n        content: prince-script(guideName);\n    }\n    @top-right {\n        content: prince-script(datestamp);\n    }\n    @bottom-right {\n        content: counter(page, lower-roman);\n    }\n    @bottom-left {\n        content: \"youremail@domain.com\";   }\n}\n\n\nWith counter(page, lower-roman), we reset the page count to 1 so that the title page doesn’t start the count. Then we also add some header and footer info. The page numbers start counting in lower-roman numerals.\n\nFinally, for the first page (which doesn’t have a specific name), we restart the counting to 1 again and this time use regular numbers.\n\nbody.first_page {counter-reset: page 1}\n\nh1 { string-set: doctitle content() }\n\n@page {\n    @top-left {\n        content: string(doctitle);\n        font-size: 11px;\n        font-style: italic;\n    }\n    @top-right {\n        content: prince-script(datestamp);\n        font-size: 11px;\n    }\n\n    @bottom-right {\n        content: \"Page \" counter(page);\n        font-size: 11px;\n    }\n    @bottom-left {\n        content: prince-script(guideName);\n        font-size: 11px;\n    }\n}\n\n\nYou’ll see some other items in there such as prince-script. This means we’re using JavaScript to run some functions to dynamically generate that content. These JavaScript functions are located in the _includes/head_print.html:\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n    Prince.addScriptFunc(\"datestamp\", function() {\n        return \"PDF last generated: January 25, 2022\";\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n    Prince.addScriptFunc(\"guideName\", function() {\n        return \" User Guide\";\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nThere are a couple of Prince functions that are default functions from Prince. This gets the heading title of the page:\n\n        content: string(doctitle);\n\n\nThis gets the current page:\n\n        content: \"Page \" counter(page);\n\n\nBecause the theme uses JavaScript in the CSS, you have to add the --javascript tag in the Prince command (detailed later on this page).\n\n5. Customize and run the PDF script\n\nDuplicate the pdf-mydoc.sh file in the root directory and customize it for your specific configuration files.\n\necho 'Killing all Jekyll instances'\nkill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')\nclear\n\necho \"Building PDF-friendly HTML site for Mydoc ...\";\njekyll serve --detach --config _config.yml,pdfconfigs/config_mydoc_pdf.yml;\necho \"done\";\n\necho \"Building the PDF ...\";\nprince --javascript --input-list=_site/pdfconfigs/prince-list.txt -o pdf/mydoc.pdf;\necho \"done\";\n\n\nNote that the first part kills all Jekyll instances. This way you won’t try to serve Jekyll at a port that is already occupied.\n\nThe jekyll serve command serves up the HTML-friendly PDF configurations for our two projects. This web version is where Prince will go to get its content.\n\nThe prince script issues a command to the Prince utility. JavaScript is enabled (--javascript), and we tell it exactly where to find the list of files (--input-list) — just point to the prince-list.txt file. Then we tell it where and what to output (-o).\n\nMake sure that the path to the prince-list.txt is correct. For the output directory, I like to output the PDF file into my project’s source (into the files folder). Then when I build the web output, the PDF is included and something I can refer to.\n\n Note: You might not want to include the PDF in your project files, since you’re likely committing the PDF to Github and as a result saving the changes from one PDF version to another with each save.\n\n6. Add conditions for your new builds in the PDF config file\n\nIn the PDF configuration file, there’s a section that looks like this:\n\n{% if site.product == \"mydoc\" %}\npdf_sidebar: product2_sidebar\n{% endif %}\n\n\nPoint to the sidebar you want here.\n\nWhat this does is allow the prince-list.txt and toc.html files to iterate through the right sidebar.  Otherwise, you would need to create a unique prince-list.txt and toc.html file for each separate PDF output you have.\n\n7. Add a download button for the PDF\n\nYou can add a download button for your PDF using some Bootstrap button code:\n\n&lt;a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"noCrossRef\" href=\"/pdf/mydoc.pdf\"&gt;&lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" aria-label=\"Left Align\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; PDF Download&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHere’s what that looks like:\n\n&lt;a target=”_blank” class=”noCrossRef” href={{ “pdf/mydoc.pdf”}}”&gt; PDF Download&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJavaScript conflicts\n\nIf you have JavaScript on any of your pages, Prince will note errors in Terminal like this:\n\nerror: TypeError: value is not an object\n\n\nHowever, the PDF will still build.\n\nYou need to conditionalize out any JavaScript from your PDF web output before building your PDFs. Make sure that the PDF configuration files have the output: pdf property.\n\nThen surround the JavaScript with conditional tags like this:\n\n{% raw %}{% unless site.output == \"pdf\" %}\njavascript content here ...\n{% endunless %}\n\n\nFor more detail about using unless in conditional logic, see Conditional logic. What this code means is “run this code unless this value is the case.”\n\nOverriding Bootstrap Print Styles\n\nThe theme relies on Bootstrap’s CSS for styling. However, for print media, Bootstrap applies the following style:\n\n@media print{*,:after,:before{color:#000!important;text-shadow:none!important;background:0 0!important;-webkit-box-shadow:none!important;box-shadow:none!important}\n\nThis is minified, but basically the * (asterisk) means select all, and applied the color #000 (black). As a result, the Bootstrap style strips out all color from the PDF (for Bootstrap elements).\n\nThis is problematic for code snippets that have syntax highlighting. I decided to remove this de-coloring from the print output. I commented out the Bootstrap style:\n\n@media print{*,:after,:before{/*color:#000!important;*/text-shadow:none!important;/*background:0 0!important*/;-webkit-box-shadow:none!important;box-shadow:none!important}\n\n\nIf you update Bootrap, make sure you make this edit. (Sorry, admittedly I couldn’t figure out how to simply overwrite the * selector with a later style.)\n\nI did, however, remove the color from the alerts and lighten the background shading for pre elements. The printstyles.css has this setting."

This is a Bootstrap specific class. If you do, the styling looks like this:\n\n\n\nfractious\nLike a little mischevious child, full of annoying and constant trouble.\n\ngratuitous\nSomething that is unwarranted and uncouth, like the social equivalent of a flagrant foul.\n\nhaughty\nProud and flaunting it.

						"title": "Help APIs and UI tooltips",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /mydoc_help_api.html",
						"content": "Full code demo of content API\n\nYou can create a help API that developers can use to pull in content.\n\nFor the full code demo, see the notes in the Tooltips file.\n\nIn this demo, the popovers pull in and display content from the information in a tooltips.json file located in the same directory.\n\nInstead of placing the JSON source in the same directory, you could also host the JSON file on another site.\n\nAdditionally, instead of tooltip popovers, you could also print content directly to the page. Basically, whatever you can stuff into a JSON file, developers can integrate it onto a page.\n\nDiagram overview\n\nHere’s a diagram showing the basic idea of the help API:\n\n\n\nIs this really an API? Well, sort of. The help content is pushed out into a JSON file that other websites and applications can easily consume. The endpoints don’t deliver different data based on parameters added to a URL. But the overall concept is similar to an API: you have a client requesting resources from a server.\n\nNote that in this scenario, the help is openly accessible on the web. If you have a private system, it’s more complicated.\n\nTo deliver help this way using Jekyll, follow the steps in each of the sections below.\n\n1. Create a “collection” for the help content\n\nA collection is another content type that extends Jekyll beyond the use of pages and posts. Call the collection “tooltips.”\n\nAdd the following information to your configuration file to declare your collection:\n\ncollections:\n  tooltips:\n    output: false\n\n\nIn your Jekyll project’s root directory, create a new folder called “_tooltips” and put every page that you want to be part of that tooltips collection inside that folder.\n\nIn Jekyll, folders that begin with an underscore (“_”) aren’t included in the output. However, in the collection information that you add to your configuration file, if you change output to true, the tooltips folder will appear in the output, and each page inside tooltips will be generated. You most likely don’t want this for tooltips (you just want the JSON file), so make the output setting false.\n\n2. Create tooltip definitions in a YAML file\n\nInside the _data folder, create a YAML file called something like definitions.yml. Add the definitions for each of your tooltips here like this:\n\nbasketball: \"Basketball is a sport involving two teams of five players each competing to put a ball through a small circular rim 10 feet above the ground. Basketball requires players to be in top physical condition, since they spend most of the game running back and forth along a 94-foot-long floor.\"\n\n\nThe definition of basketball is stored this data file so that you can re-use it in other parts of the help as well. You’ll likely want the definition to appear not only in the tooltip in the UI, but also in the regular documentation as well.\n\n3. Create pages in your collection\n\nCreate pages inside your new tooltips collection (that is, inside the _tooltips folder). Each page needs to have a unique id in the frontmatter as well as a product. Then reference the definition you created in the definitions.yml file.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n\n---\ndoc_id: basketball\nproduct: mydoc\n---\n\n{{site.data.definitions.basketball}}\n\n\n(Note: Avoid using id, as it seems to generate out as /tooltips/basketball instead of just `basketball.)\n\nYou need to create a separate file for each tooltip you want to deliver.\n\nThe product attribute is required in the frontmatter to distinguish the tooltips produced here from the tooltips for other products in the same _tooltips folder. When creating the JSON file, Jekyll will iterate through all the pages inside _tooltips, regardless of any subfolders included here.\n\n4. Create a JSON file that loops through your collection pages\n\nNow it’s time to create a JSON file with Liquid code that iterates through our tooltip collection and grabs the information from each tooltip file.\n\nInside your project’s pages directory (e.g., mydoc), add a file called “tooltips.json.” (You can use whatever name you want.) Add the following to your JSON file:\n\n---\nlayout: null\nsearch: exclude\n---\n\n{\n\"entries\":\n[\n{% for page in site.tooltips %}\n{\n\"doc_id\": \"{{ page.doc_id }}\",\n\"body\": \"{{ page.content | strip_newlines | replace: '\\', '\\\\\\\\' | replace: '\"', '\\\\\"' }}\"\n} {% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n]\n}\n\n\n\nThis code will loop through all pages in the tooltips collection and insert the id and body into key-value pairs for the JSON code. Here’s an example of what that looks like after it’s processed by Jekyll in the site build:\n\n{\n  \"entries\": [\n    {\n      \"doc_id\": \"baseball\",\n      \"body\": \"Baseball is considered America's pasttime sport, though that may be more of a historical term than a current one. There's a lot more excitement about football than baseball. A baseball game is somewhat of a snooze to watch, for the most part.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"doc_id\": \"basketball\",\n      \"body\": \"Basketball is a sport involving two teams of five players each competing to put a ball through a small circular rim 10 feet above the ground. Basketball requires players to be in top physical condition, since they spend most of the game running back and forth along a 94-foot-long floor.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"doc_id\": \"football\",\n      \"body\": \"No doubt the most fun sport to watch, football also manages to accrue the most injuries with the players. From concussions to blown knees, football players have short sport lives.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"doc_id\": \"soccer\",\n      \"body\": \"If there's one sport that dominates the world landscape, it's soccer. However, US soccer fans are few and far between. Apart from the popularity of soccer during the World Cup, most people don't even know the name of the professional soccer organization in their area.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nYou can also view the same JSON file here: tooltips.json.\n\nYou can add different fields depending on how you want the JSON to be structured. Here we just have to fields: doc_id and body. And the JSON is looking just in the tooltips collection that we created.\n\n Tip: Check out Google’s style guide for JSON. These best practices can help you keep your JSON file valid.\n\nNote that you can create different JSON files that specialize in different content. For example, suppose you have some getting started information. You could put that into a different JSON file. Using the same structure, you might add an if tag that checks whether the page has frontmatter that says type: getting_started or something. Or you could put the content into separate collection entirely (different from tooltips).\n\nBy chunking up your JSON files, you can provide a quicker lookup. (I’m not sure how big the JSON file can be before you experience any latency with the jQuery lookup.)\n\n5. Build your site and look for the JSON file\n\nWhen you build your site, Jekyll will iterate through every page in your _tooltips folder and put the page id and body into this format. In the output, look for the JSON file in the tooltips.json file. You’ll see that Jekyll has populated it with content. This is because of the triple hyphen lines in the JSON file — this instructs Jekyll to process the file.\n\n6. Allow CORS access to your help if stored on a remote server\n\nYou can simply deliver the JSON file to devs to add to the project. But if you have the option, it’s best to keep the JSON file stored in your own help system. Assuming you have the ability to update your content on the fly, this will give you completely control over the tooltips without being tied to a specific release window.\n\nWhen people make calls to your site from other domains, you must allow them access to get the content. To do this, you have to enable something called CORS (cross origin resource sharing) within the server where your help resides.\n\nIn other words, people are going to be executing calls to reach into your site and grab your content. Just like the door on your house, you have to unlock it so people can get in. Enabling CORS is unlocking it.\n\nHow you enable CORS depends on the type of server.\n\nIf your server setup allows htaccess files to override general server permissions, create an .htaccess file and add the following:\n\nHeader set Access-Control-Allow-Origin \"*\"\n\n\nStore this in the same directory as your project. This is what I’ve done in a directory on my web host (bluehost.com). Inside http://idratherassets.com/wp-content/apidemos/, I uploaded a file called “.htaccess” with the preceding code.\n\nAfter I uploaded it, I renamed it to .htaccess, right-clicked the file and set the permissions to 774.\n\nTo test whether your server permissions are set correctly, open a terminal and run the following curl command pointing to your tooltips.json file:\n\ncurl -I http://idratherassets.com/wp-content/apidemos/tooltips.json\n\n\nThe -I command tells cURL to return the request header only.\n\nIf the server permissions are set correctly, you should see the following line somewhere in the response:\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n\n\nIf you don’t see this response, CORS isn’t allowed for the file.\n\nIf you have an AWS S3 bucket, you can supposedly add a CORS configuration to the bucket permissions. Log into AWS S3 and click your bucket. On the right, in the Permissions section, click Add CORS Configuration. In that space, add the following policy:\n\n&lt;CORSConfiguration&gt;\n &lt;CORSRule&gt;\n   &lt;AllowedOrigin&gt;*&lt;/AllowedOrigin&gt;\n   &lt;AllowedMethod&gt;GET&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt;\n &lt;/CORSRule&gt;\n&lt;/CORSConfiguration&gt;\n\n\n(Although this should work, in my experiment it doesn’t. And I’m not sure why…)\n\nIn other server setups, you may need to edit one of your Apache configuration files. See Enable CORS or search online for ways to allow CORS for your server.\n\nIf you don’t have CORS enabled, users will see a CORS error/warning message in the console of the page making the request.\n\n Tip: If enabling CORS is problematic, you could always just send developers the tooltips.json file and ask them to place it on their own server.\n\n7. Explain how developers can access the help\n\nDevelopers can access the help using the .get method from jQuery, among other methods. Here’s an example of how to get tooltips for basketball, baseball, football, and soccer:\n\nvar url = \"tooltips.json\";\n\n         $.get( url, function( data ) {\n\n          /* Bootstrap popover text is defined inside a data-content attribute inside an element. That's\n          why I'm using attr here. If you just want to insert content on the page, use append and remove the data-content argument from the parentheses.*/\n\n             $.each(data.entries, function(i, page) {\n                 if (page.doc_id == \"basketball\") {\n                     $( \"#basketball\" ).attr( \"data-content\", page.body );\n                 }\n\n                 if (page.doc_id == \"baseball\") {\n                     $( \"#baseball\" ).attr( \"data-content\", page.body );\n                 }\n                 if (page.doc_id == \"football\") {\n                     $( \"#football\" ).attr( \"data-content\", page.body );\n                 }\n\n                 if (page.doc_id == \"soccer\") {\n                     $( \"#soccer\" ).attr( \"data-content\", page.body );\n                 }\n\n\n                 });\n             });\n\n\nView the tooltip demo for a demonstration. See the source code for full code details.\n\nThe url in the demo is relative, but you could equally point it to an absolute path on a remote host assuming CORS is enabled on the host.\n\nThe each method looks through all the JSON content to find the item whose page.id is equal to basketball. It then looks for an element on the page named #basketball and adds a data-content attribute to that element.\n\n Warning: Make sure your JSON file is valid. Otherwise, this method won’t work. I use the JSON Formatter extension for Chrome. When I go to the tooltips.json page in my browser, the JSON content — if valid — is nicely formatted (and includes some color coding). If the file isn’t valid, it’s not formatted and there isn’t any color. You can also check the JSON formatting using JSON Formatter and Validator. If your JSON file isn’t valid, identify the problem area using the validator and troubleshoot the file causing issues. It’s usually due to some code that isn’t escaping correctly.\n\nWhy data-content? Well, in this case, I’m using Bootstrap popovers to display the tooltip content. The data-content attribute is how Bootstrap injects popovers.\n\nHere’s the section on the page where the popover is inserted:\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basketball &lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign\" id=\"basketball\" data-toggle=\"popover\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\nNotice that I just have id=\"basketball\" added to this popover element. Developers merely need to add a unique ID to each tooltip they want to pull in the help content. Either you tell developers the unique ID they should add, or ask them what IDs they added (or just tell them to use an ID that matches the field’s name).\n\nIn order to use jQuery and Bootstrap, you’ll need to add the appropriate references in the head tags of your page:\n\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\"&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n$(document).ready(function(){\n    $('[data-toggle=\"popover\"]').popover({\n        placement : 'right',\n        trigger: 'hover',\n        html: true\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nAgain, see the Tooltip Demo for a demo of the full code.\n\nNote that even though you reference a Bootstrap JS script, Bootstrap’s popovers require you to initialize them using the above code as well — they aren’t turned on by default.\n\nView the source code of the tooltip demo for the full comments.\n\n8. Create easy links to embed the help in your help site\n\nYou might also want to insert the same content into different parts of your help site. For example, if you have tooltips providing definitions for fields, you’ll probably want to create a page in your help that lists those same definitions.\n\nYou could use the same method developers use to pull help content into their applications. But it will probably be easier to simply use Jekyll’s tags for doing it.\n\nHere’s how you would reuse the content:\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Reuse Demo&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Sport&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Comments&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Basketball&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;{{site.data.definitions.basketball}}&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Baseball&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;{{site.data.definitions.baseball}}&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Football&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;{{site.data.definitions.football}}&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Soccer&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;{{site.data.definitions.soccer}}&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n\nAnd here’s the code:\n\nReuse Demo\n\n\n\n\nSport\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\nBasketball\nBasketball is a sport involving two teams of five players each competing to put a ball through a small circular rim 10 feet above the ground. Basketball requires players to be in top physical condition, since they spend most of the game running back and forth along a 94-foot-long floor.\n\n\n\nBaseball\nBaseball is considered America's pasttime sport, though that may be more of a historical term than a current one. There's a lot more excitement about football than baseball. A baseball game is somewhat of a snooze to watch, for the most part.\n\n\n\nFootball\nNo doubt the most fun sport to watch, football also manages to accrue the most injuries with the players. From concussions to blown knees, football players have short sport lives.\n\n\n\nSoccer\nIf there's one sport that dominates the world landscape, it's soccer. However, US soccer fans are few and far between. Apart from the popularity of soccer during the World Cup, most people don't even know the name of the professional soccer organization in their area.\n\n\n\n\nNow you have both documentation and UI tooltips generated from the same definitions file."

						"content": "Font icon options\nThe theme has two font icon sets integrated: Font Awesome and Glyphicons Halflings. The latter is part of Bootstrap, while the former is independent. Font icons allow you to insert icons drawn as vectors from a CDN (so you don’t have any local images on your own site).\n\nExternal icons\n\nWhen you link to an external site, like Jekyll, an icon appears after the link. If you want to remove this icon, comment out this style in css/customstyles.css.\n\n/* this part adds an icon after external links, using FontAwesome*/\na[href^=\"http://\"]:after, a[href^=\"https://\"]:after {\n    content: \"\\f08e\";\n    font-family: FontAwesome;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-style: normal;\n    display: inline-block;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    padding-left: 3px;\n}\n\n\nSee Font Awesome icons available\n\nGo to the Font Awesome library to see the available icons.\n\nThe Font Awesome icons allow you to adjust their size by simply adding fa-2x, fa-3x and so forth as a class to the icon to adjust their size to two times or three times the original size. As vector icons, they scale crisply at any size.\n\nHere’s an example of how to scale up a camera icon:\n\n&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; normal size (1x)\n&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-lg\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-lg\n&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-2x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-2x\n&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-3x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-3x\n&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-4x\n&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-5x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-5x\n\n\nHere’s what they render to:\n\n 1x\n fa-lg\n fa-2x\n fa-3x\n fa-4x\n fa-5x\n\nWith Font Awesome, you always use the i tag with the appropriate class. You also implement fa as a base class first. You can use font awesome icons inside other elements. Here I’m using a Font Awesome class inside a Bootstrap alert:\n\n&lt;div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-circle\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Warning: &lt;/b&gt;This is a special warning message.\n\n\nHere’s the result:\n\n This is a special warning message.\n\nThe notes, tips, warnings, etc., are pre-coded with Font Awesome and stored in the alerts.yml file. That file includes the following:\n\ntip: '&lt;div class=\"alert alert-success\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;'\nnote: '&lt;div class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;'\nimportant: '&lt;div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-warning\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;'\nwarning: '&lt;div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-circle\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Warning: &lt;/b&gt;'\nend: '&lt;/div&gt;'\n\ncallout_danger: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-danger\"&gt;'\ncallout_default: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-default\"&gt;'\ncallout_primary: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-primary\"&gt;'\ncallout_success: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-success\"&gt;'\ncallout_info: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"&gt;'\ncallout_warning: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-warning\"&gt;'\n\nhr_faded: '&lt;hr class=\"faded\"/&gt;'\nhr_shaded: '&lt;hr class=\"shaded\"/&gt;'\n\n\nThis means you can insert a tip, note, warning, or important alert simply by using these tags.\n\n{% include note.html content=\"Add your note here.\" %}\n\n\n{% include tip.html content=\"Add your tip here.\" %}\n\n\n{% include important.html content=\"Add your important info here.\" %}\n\n\n{% include warning.html content=\"Add your warning here.\" %}\n\n\nHere’s the result:\n\n Note: Add your note here.\n\n Tip: Here’s my tip.\n\n Important: This information is very important.\n\n Warning: If you overlook this, you may die.\n\nThe color scheme is the default colors from Bootstrap. You can modify the icons or colors as needed.\n\nCreating your own combinations\n\nYou can innovate with your own combinations. Here’s a similar approach with a file download icon:\n\n&lt;div class=\"alert alert-success\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-download fa-lg\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; This is a special tip about some file to download....&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nAnd the result:\n\n This is a special tip about some file to download....\n\nGrab the right class name from the Font Awesome library and then implement it by following the pattern shown previously.\n\nIf you want to make your fonts even larger than the 5x style, add a custom style to your stylesheet like this:\n\n.fa-10x{font-size:1700%;}\n\n\nThen any element with the attribute fa-10x will be enlarged 1700%.\n\nGlyphicon icons available\n\nGlyphicons work similarly to Font Awesome. Go to the Glyphicons library to see the icons available.\n\nAlthough the Glyphicon Halflings library doesn’t provide the scalable classes like Font Awesome, there’s a StackOverflow trick  to make the icons behave in a similar way. This theme’s stylesheet (customstyles.css) includes the following to the stylesheet:\n\n.gi-2x{font-size: 2em;}\n.gi-3x{font-size: 3em;}\n.gi-4x{font-size: 4em;}\n.gi-5x{font-size: 5em;}\n\n\nNow you just add gi-5x or whatever to change the size of the font icon:\n\n&lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-globe gi-5x\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\nAnd here’s the result:\n\n\n\nGlypicons use the span element instead of i to attach their classes.\n\nHere’s another example:\n\n&lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n\nAnd magnified:\n\n&lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download gi-3x\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYou can also put glyphicons inside other elements:\n\n&lt;div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\"&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;b&gt;Error:&lt;/b&gt; Enter a valid email address\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n  Error: Enter a valid email address\n\n\nCallouts\n\nThe previously shown alerts might be fine for short messages, but with longer notes, the solid color takes up a bit of space. In this theme, you also have the option of using callouts, which are pretty common in Bootstrap’s documentation but surprisingly not offered as an explicit element. Their styles have been copied into this theme, in a way similar to the alerts:\n\n&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"&gt;\n This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. \n\nAnd here’s the shortcode:\n\n{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}This is a special callout information message.{{site.data.alerts.end}}\n\n\n\nHere’s the result:\n\nThis is a special callout information message.\n\nYou can use any of the following:\n\n{{site.data.alerts.callout_default}}\n{{site.data.alerts.callout_primary}}\n{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}\n{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}\n{{site.data.alerts.callout_warning}}\n\n\nThe only difference is the color of the left bar.\n\nCallouts are explained in a bit more detail in Alerts."

In Illustrator, when you do a Save As with your AI file and choose SVG, to preserve your fonts, in the Font section, select “Convert to outline” as the Type (don’t choose SVG in the Font section).\n\nAlso, remove the check box for “Use textpath element for text on a path”. And select “Embed” rather than “Link.” The following screenshot shows the settings I use. Your graphics will look great in Firefox.\n\nEssential options for SVG with Illustrator"

You should get a response indicating the location of Ruby and Rubygems.\n\nIf you get responses that look like this:\n\n/usr/local/bin/ruby\n\n\nand\n\n/usr/local/bin/gem\n\n\nGreat! Skip down to the Bundler section.\n\nHowever, if your location is something like /Users/MacBookPro/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/gem, which points to your system location of Rubygems, you will likely run into permissions errors when trying to get a gem. A sample permissions error (triggered when you try to install the jekyll gem such as gem install jekyll) might look like this for Rubygems:\n\n &gt;ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)\n  You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.\n\n\nInstead of changing the write permissions on your operating system’s version of Ruby and Rubygems (which could pose security issues), you can install another instance of Ruby (one that is writable) to get around this.\n\nInstall Homebrew\n\nHomebrew is a package manager for the Mac, and you can use it to install an alternative instance of Ruby code. To install Homebrew, run this command:\n\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n\nIf you already had Homebrew installed on your computer, be sure to update it:\n\nbrew update\n\n\nInstall Ruby through Homebrew\n\nNow use Homebrew to install Ruby:\n\nbrew install ruby\n\n\nLog out of terminal, and then then log back in.\n\nWhen you type which ruby and which gem, you should get responses like this:\n\n/usr/local/bin/ruby\n\n\nAnd this:\n\n/usr/local/bin/gem\n\n\nNow Ruby and Rubygems are installed under your username, so these directories are writeable.\n\nNote that if you don’t see these paths, try restarting your computer or try installing rbenv, which is a Ruby version management tool. If you still have issues getting a writeable version of Ruby, you need to resolve them before installing Bundler.\n\nInstall the Jekyll gem\n\nAt this point you should have a writeable version of Ruby and Rubygem on your machine.\n\nNow use gem to install Jekyll:\n\ngem install jekyll\n\n\nYou can now use Jekyll to create new Jekyll sites following the quick-start instructions on Jekyllrb.com.\n\nInstalling dependencies through Bundler\n\nSome Jekyll themes will require certain Ruby gem dependencies. These dependencies are stored in something called a Gemfile, which is packaged with the Jekyll theme. You can install these dependencies through Bundler. (Although you don’t need to install Bundler for this Documentation theme, it’s a good idea to do so.)\n\nBundler is a package manager for RubyGems. You can use it to get all the gems (or Ruby plugins) that you need for your Jekyll project.\n\nYou install Bundler by using the gem command with RubyGems:\n\ngem install bundler\n\n\nIf you’re prompted to switch to superuser mode (sudo) to get the correct permissions to install Bundler in that directory, avoid doing this. All other applications that need to use Bundler will likely not have the needed permissions to run.\n\nBundler goes out and retreives all the gems that are specified in a Jekyll project’s Gemfile. If you have a gem that depends on other gems to work, Bundler will go out and retrieve all of the dependencies as well. (To learn more about Bundler, see About Ruby Gems.\n\nThe vanilla Jekyll site you create through jekyll new my-awesome-site doesn’t have a Gemfile, but many other themes (including the Documentation theme for Jekyll) do have a Gemfile.\n\nServe the Jekyll Documentation theme\n\n\n  Browse to the directory where you downloaded the Documentation theme for Jekyll.\n  Type jekyll serve\n  Go to the preview address in the browser. (Make sure you include the / at the end.)\n\n\nResolve “No Github API authentication” errors\n\nAfter making an edit, Jekyll auto-rebuilds the site. If you have the Gemfile in the theme with the github-pages gem, you may see the following error:\n\nGitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.\n\n\nIf you see this error, you will need to take some additional steps to resolve it. (Note that this error only appears if you have the github-pages gem in your gemfile.) The resolution involves adding a Github token and a cert file.\n\n Note: These instructions apply to Mac OS X, but they’re highly similar to Windows. These instructions are adapted from a post on Knight Codes. If you’re on Windows, see the Knight Codes post for details instead of following along below.\n\nTo resolve the “No Github API authentication” error:\n\n\n  Follow Github’s instructions to create a personal access token.\n  \n    Open the .bash_profile file in your user directory:\n\n    open ~/.bash_profile\n    \n\n    The file will open in your default terminal editor. If you don’t have a .bash_profile file, you can just create a file with this name. Note that files that begin with . are hidden, so if you’re looking in your user directory for the file, use ls -a to see hidden files.\n  \n  \n    In your .bash_profile file, reference your token as a system variable like this:\n\n    export JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN=abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123\n    \n\n    Replace abc123... with your own token that you generated in step 1.\n  \n  Go to [https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem][https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem]. Right-click the page, select **Save as, and save the file on your computer (save it somewhere safe, where you won’t delete it). Name the file cacert.\n  \n    Open your .bash_profile file again and add this line, replacing Users/johndoe/projects/ with the path to your cacert.pem file:\n\n    export SSL_CERT_FILE=/Users/johndoe/projects/cacert.pem\n    \n  \n  Close and restart your terminal.\n\n\nBrowse to your jekyll project and run bundle exec jekyll serve. Make an edit to a file and observe that no Github API errors appear when Jekyll rebuilds the project."

Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.\n\n\nIf so, you will need to take some additional steps to resolve it. (Note that this error only appears if you have the github-pages gem in your gemfile.) The resolution involves adding a Github token and a cert file.\n\nSee this post on Knight Codes for instructions on how to fix the error. You basically generate a personal token on Github and set it as a system variable. You also download a certification file and set it as a system variable. This resolves the issue."

						"content": "Overview\n\nThis site provides documentation, training, and other notes for the Jekyll Documentation theme. There’s a lot of information about how to do a variety of things here, and it’s not all unique to this theme. But by and large, understanding how to do things in Jekyll depends on how your theme is coded. As a result, these additional details are provided.\n\nThe instructions here are geared towards technical writers working on documentation. You may have a team of one or more technical writers working on documentation for multiple projects. You can use this same theme to author all of your documentation for each of your products. The theme is built to accommodate documentation for multiple products on the same site.\n\nSurvey of features\n\nSome of the more prominent features of this theme include the following:\n\n\n  Bootstrap framework\n  Navgoco multi-level sidebar for table of contents\n  Ability to specify different sidebars for different products\n  Top navigation bar with drop-down menus\n  Notes, tips, and warning information notes\n  Tags for alternative navigation\n  Advanced landing page layouts from the Modern Business theme.\n\n\nGetting started\n\nTo get started, see Getting Started."

Use one space for numbers 10 and up. If any part of your list doesn’t align symmetrically on this left edge, the list will not render correctly.

Refresh your page to see the tab you selected remain active.\n\n\n    Profile\n    About\n    Match\n\n\n\n    Profile\n\n    Praesent sit amet fermentum leo.

Quisque ut condimentum massa. Proin venenatis leo id urna cursus blandit. Vivamus sit amet hendrerit metus.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nHere’s the code for the above (with the filler text abbreviated):\n\n&lt;ul id=\"profileTabs\" class=\"nav nav-tabs\"&gt;\n    &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#profile\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#about\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#match\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;Match&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"tab-content\"&gt;\n&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane active\" id=\"profile\"&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Profile&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Praesent sit amet fermentum leo....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"about\"&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"match\"&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Match&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Vel vehicula ....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nDesign constraints\n\nBootstrap automatically clears any floats after the navtab. Make sure you aren’t trying to float any element to the right of your navtabs, or there will be some awkward space in your layout.\n\nAppearance in the mini-TOC\n\nIf you put a heading in the navtab content, that heading will appear in the mini-TOC as long as the heading tag has an ID. If you don’t want the headings for each navtab section to appear in the mini-TOC, omit the ID attribute from the heading tag. Without this ID attribute in the heading, the mini-TOC won’t insert the heading title into the mini-TOC.\n\nMust use HTML\n\nYou must use HTML within the navtab content because each navtab section is surrounded with HTML, and you can’t use Markdown inside of HTML.\n\nMatch up ID tags\n\nEach tab’s href attribute must match the id attribute of the tab content’s div section. So if your tab has href=\"#acme\", then you add acme as the ID attribute in &lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"acme\"&gt;.\n\nSet an active tab\nOne of the tabs needs to be set as active, depending on what tab you want to be open by default (usually the first one).\n\n&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane active\" id=\"acme\"&gt;\n\n\nSets a cookie\n\nThe navtabs are part of Bootstrap, but this theme sets a cookie to remember the last tab’s state. The js/customscripts.js file has a long chunk of JavaScript that sets the cookie. The JavaScript comes from this StackOverflow thread.\n\nBy setting a cookie, if the user refreshes the page, the active tab is the tab the user last selected (rather than defaulting to the default active tab).\n\nFunctionality to implement\n\nOne piece of functionality I’d like to implement is the ability to set site-wide nav tab options. For example, if the user always chooses PHP instead of Java in the code samples, it would be great to set this option site-wide by default. However, this functionality isn’t yet coded."

					"mydoc-pages-html": {
						"id": "mydoc-pages-html",
						"title": "Pages",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /mydoc_pages.html",
						"content": "Where to author content\nUse a text editor such as Sublime Text, WebStorm, IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code or Atom to create pages. Atom is recommended because it’s created by Github, which is driving some of the Jekyll development through Github Pages.\n\nWhere to save pages\n\nYou can store your pages in any folder structures you want, with any level of folder nesting. The site output will pull all of those pages out of their folders and put them into the root directory. Check out the _site folder, which is where Jekyll is generated, to see the difference between your project’s structure and the resulting site output.\n\nThe listing of all pages in the root directory (which happens when you add a permalink property to the pages) is what allows the relative linking and offline viewing of the site to work.\n\nFrontmatter\n\nMake sure each page has frontmatter at the top like this:\n\n---\ntitle: Alerts\ntags: [formatting]\nkeywords: notes, tips, cautions, warnings, admonitions\nlast_updated: July 3, 2016\nsummary: \"You can insert notes, tips, warnings, and important alerts in your content.\"\nsidebar: mydoc_sidebar\npermalink: mydoc_alerts.html\n---\n\n\nFrontmatter is always formatted with three hyphens at the top and bottom. Your frontmatter must have a title and permalink value. All the other values are optional.\n\nNote that you cannot use variables in frontmatter.\n\nThe following table describes each of the frontmatter that you can use with this theme:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Frontmatter\n      Required?\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      title\n      Required\n      The title for the page\n    \n    \n      tags\n      Optional\n      Tags for the page. Make all tags single words, with underscores if needed (rather than spaces). Separate them with commas. Enclose the whole list within brackets. Also, note that tags must be added to _data/tags_doc.yml to be allowed entrance into the page. This prevents tags from becoming somewhat random and unstructured. You must create a tag page for each one of your tags following the pattern shown in the tags folder. (Tag pages aren’t automatically created.)\n    \n    \n      keywords\n      Optional\n      Synonyms and other keywords for the page. This information gets stuffed into the page’s metadata to increase SEO. The user won’t see the keywords, but if you search for one of the keywords, it will be picked up by the search engine.\n    \n    \n      last_updated\n      Optional\n      The date the page was last updated. This information could helpful for readers trying to evaluate how current and authoritative information is. If included, the last_updated date appears in the footer of the page in small font.\n    \n    \n      sidebar\n      Required\n      Refers to the sidebar data file for this page. Don’t include the “.yml” file extension for the sidebar — just provide the file name. If no sidebar is specified, this value will inherit the default property set in your _config.yml file for the page’s frontmatter.\n    \n    \n      summary\n      Optional\n      A 1-2 word sentence summarizing the content on the page. This gets formatted into the summary section in the page layout. Adding summaries is a key way to make your content more scannable by users (check out Jakob Nielsen’s site for a great example of page summaries.) The only drawback with summaries is that you can’t use variables in them.\n    \n    \n      permalink\n      Required\n      The permalink must match the filename in order for automated links to work. Additionally, you must include the “.html” in the filename. Do not put forward slashes around the permalink (this makes Jekyll put the file inside a folder in the output). When Jekyll builds the site, it will put the page into the root directory rather than leaving it in a subdirectory or putting it inside a folder and naming the file index.html. Having all files flattened in the root directory is essential for relative linking to work and for all paths to JS and CSS files to be valid.\n    \n    \n      datatable\n      Optional\n      ‘true’. If you add datatable: true in the frontmatter, scripts for the jQuery Datatables plugin get included on the page. You can see the scripts that conditionally appear by looking in the _layouts/default.html page.\n    \n    \n      toc\n      Optional\n      If you specify toc: false in the frontmatter, the page won’t have the table of contents that appears below the title. The toc refers to the list of jump links below the page title, not the sidebar navigation. You probably want to hide the TOC on the homepage and product landing pages.\n    \n  \n\n\nColons in page titles\n\nIf you want to use a colon in your page title, you must enclose the title’s value in quotation marks.\n\nPage names and excluding files from outputs\n\nBy default, everything in your project is included in the output. You can exclude all files that don’t belong to that project by specifying the file name, the folder name, or by using wildcards in your configuration file:\n\nexclude:\n\n- filename.md\n- subfolder_name/\n- mydoc_*\n- gitignore\n\n\nWildcards will exclude every match after the *.\n\nSaving pages as drafts\n\nIf you add published: false in the frontmatter, your page won’t be published. You can also move draft pages into the _drafts folder to exclude them from the build. With posts, you can also keep them as drafts by omitting the date in the title.\n\nMarkdown or HTML format\n\nPages can be either Markdown or HTML format (specified through either an .md or .html file extension).\n\nIf you use Markdown, you can also include HTML formatting where needed. But if your format is HTML, you must add a markdown=\"1\" attribute to the element in order to use Markdown inside that HTML element:\n\n&lt;div markdown=\"1\"&gt;This is a [link](http://exmaple.com).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nFor your Markdown files, note that a space or two indent will set text off as code or blocks, so avoid spacing indents unless intentional.\n\nIf you have a lot of HTML, as long as the top and bottom tags of the HTML are flush left in a Markdown file, all the tags inside those bookend HTML tags will render as HTML, regardless of their indentation. (This can be especially useful for tables.)\n\nPage names\n\nI recommend prefixing your page names with the product, such as “mydoc_pages” instead of just “pages.” This way if you have other products that also have topics with generic names such as “pages,” there won’t be naming conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, consider adding the product name in parentheses after the title, such as “Pages (Mydoc)” so that users can clearly navigate different topics for each product.\n\nKramdown Markdown\n\nKramdown is the Markdown flavor used in the theme but you are free to move to CommonMark or Redcarpet. This mostly aligns with Github-flavored Markdown, but with some differences in the indentation allowed within lists. Basically, Kramdown requires you to line up the indent between list items with the first starting character after the space in your list item numbering. See this blog post on Kramdown and Rouge for more details.\n\nYou can use standard Multimarkdown syntax for tables. You can also use fenced code blocks with lexers specifying the type of code. The configuration file shows the Markdown processor and extension:\n\nhighlighter: rouge\nmarkdown: kramdown\nkramdown:\n input: GFM\n auto_ids: true\n hard_wrap: false\n syntax_highlighter: rouge\n\n\nAutomatic mini-TOCs\n\nBy default, a TOC appears at the top of your pages and posts. If you don’t want the TOC to appear for a specific page, such as for a landing page or other homepage, add toc: false in the frontmatter of the page.\n\nThe mini-TOC requires you to use the ## Markdown syntax for headings. If you use &lt;h2&gt; elements, you must add an ID attribute for the heading element in order for it to appear in the mini-TOC (for example, &lt;h2 id=\"mysampleid\"&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&gt;.\n\nHeadings\n\nUse pound signs before the heading title to designate the level. Note that kramdown requires headings to have one space before and after the heading. Without this space above and below, the heading won’t render into HTML.\n\n## Second-level heading\n\n\nResult:\n\nSecond-level heading\n\n\n\n### Third-level heading\n\nResult:\n\nThird-level heading\n\n\n\n#### Fourth-level heading\n\n\nResult:\n\nFourth-level heading\n\nHeadings with ID Tags\n\nIf you want to use a specific ID tag with your heading, add it like this:\n\n## Headings with ID Tags {#someIdTag}\n\n\nThen you can reference it with a link like this on the same page:\n\n[Some link](#someIdTag)\n\n\nResult:\n\nSome link\n\nFor details about linking to headings on different pages, see Automated links to headings on pages.\n\nSpecify a particular page layout\n\nThe configuration file sets the default layout for pages as the “page” layout.\n\nYou can create other layouts inside the layouts folder. If you create a new layout, you can specify that your page use your new layout by adding layout: mylayout.html in the page’s frontmatter. Whatever layout you specify in the frontmatter of a page will override the layout default set in the configuration file.\n\nComments\n\nDisqus, a commenting system, is integrated into the theme. In the configuration file, specify the Disqus code for the universal code, and Disqus will appear. If you don’t add a Disqus value, the Disqus form isn’t included."

You can use any number of subfolders here that you want.\n\nPosts use the post.html layout in the _layouts folder when you are viewing the post.\n\nThe news.html file in the root directory shows a reverse chronological listing of the 10 latest posts\n\nAllowed frontmatter\n\nThe frontmatter you can use with posts is as follows:\n\n---\ntitle: My sample post\ntags: content_types\nkeywords: pages, authoring, exclusion, frontmatter\nsidebar: mydoc_sidebar\npermalink: mydoc_pages.html\nsummary: \"This is some summary frontmatter for my sample post.\"\n---\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Frontmatter\n      Required?\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      title\n      Required\n      The title for the page\n    \n    \n      tags\n      Optional\n      Tags for the page. Make all tags single words, with underscores if needed. Separate them with commas. Enclose the whole list within brackets. Also, note that tags must be added to _data/tags_doc.yml to be allowed entrance into the page. This prevents tags from becoming somewhat random and unstructured. You must create a tag page for each one of your tags following the sample pattern in the tabs folder. (Tag pages aren’t automatically created.)\n    \n    \n      keywords\n      Optional\n      Synonyms and other keywords for the page. This information gets stuffed into the page’s metadata to increase SEO. The user won’t see the keywords, but if you search for one of the keywords, it will be picked up by the search engine.\n    \n    \n      sidebar\n      Required\n      Refers to the sidebar data file for this page. Don’t include the “.yml” file extension for the sidebar — just provide the file name. If no sidebar is specified, this value will inherit the default property set in your _config.yml file for the page’s frontmatter.\n    \n    \n      permalink\n      Required\n      This theme uses permalinks to facilitate the linking. You specify the permalink want for the page, and the _site output will put the page into the root directory when you publish. Follow the same convention here as you do with page permalinks – list the file name followed by the .html extension.\n    \n    \n      summary\n      Optional\n      A 1-2 word sentence summarizing the content on the page. This gets formatted into the summary section in the page layout. Adding summaries is a key way to make your content more scannable by users (check out Jakob Nielsen’s site for a great example of page summaries.) The only drawback with summaries is that you can’t use variables in them."

						"content": "Unique sidebars for each product\n\nIn previous versions of the theme, I built the theme to generate different outputs for different scenarios based on various filtering attributes that might include product, version, platform, and audience variants.\n\nHowever, this model results in siloed outputs and lots of separate file directories to manage. Instead of having 30 separate sites for your content (or however many variants you might have been producing), in this version of the theme I’ve moved towards a strategy of having one site with multiple products.\n\nFor each product, you can associate a unique sidebar with each of the product’s pages. This allows you to have all your documentation on one site, but with separate navigation that is tailored to a view of that product.\n\nYou can still output to both web and PDF. And if you really need multiple site outputs, you can still do so by using multiple configuration files that trigger different builds. But my conclusion after using the multiple site output model for some years is that it’s a bad practice for tech comm.\n\nPermalinks\n\nWith this theme, since you’ll be publishing to one site, I’ve implement permalinks instead of relative links. Using permalinks means the way you store pages is much more flexible. You can store topics in folders and subfolders, etc., to any degree. But note that with permalinks you can’t view the content offline (outside of Jekyll’s preview server) nor on a separate site other than the one specified in the configuration file. Permalinks are how Jekyll was designed to work, and the sites just work better that way.\n\nKramdown and Rouge\n\nI also switched from redcarpet and Pygments to Kramdown and Rouge to align with the current direction of Jekyll 3.0. Kramdown is a Markdown filter (it’s slightly different from Github-flavored Markdown). Rouge is a syntax highlighter. Pygments had some dependencies on Python, which made it more cumbersome for Windows users.\n\nBlog feature\n\nI included a blog feature with this version of the theme. You can write posts and view them through the News link. There’s also an archive for blog posts that sorts posts by year.\n\nAdditionally, the tagging system works across both the blog and pages, so your tags allow users to move laterally across the site based on topics they’re interested in. When you view a tag archive, the sidebar shows a list of tags.\n\nUpdated documentation\n\nI updated the documentation for  the theme. The switch from the multi-site outputs to the single-site with multiple sidebars required updating a lot of different parts of the documentation and code.\n\nFixed errors\n\nPreviously I had some errors with the HTML that showed up in w3c HTML validator analyses. This caused some small problems in certain browsers or systems less tolerant of the errors. I fixed all of the errors.\n\nAccessing the old theme\n\nIf you want to access the old theme, you can still find it here."

						"content": "Relative links\n\nYou can now view the site offline rather than solely through the Jekyll preview server or deployed on a web server. The linking approach in both the sidebar and with inline links uses relative linking throughout.\n\nSubfolders for pages\n\nYou can creates folders and subfolders for your pages, similar to how you can store posts in folders and subfolders. When Jekyll builds the site, all pages get pushed into the root directory as single html files (rather than being pushed inside folders, or remaining in subfolders). See Pages for more details.\n\nAlerts templates\n\nYou can use include templates for notes, tips, and warnings. These include templates make it easier to insert notes. If you make an error, you’re immediately made aware since the site won’t build. See Alerts for more details.\n\nImage templates\n\nSimilar to alerts, images also have include templates. You can insert both regular images and inline images, such as images that are a button or icon. See Images for more details.\n\nAutomated links using Markdown formatting\n\nInstead of using YAML references to handle links, I’ve switched to a Markdown reference style approach. A links.html file iterates through the sidebar files and formats the content in the Markdown reference. You then just use Markdown syntax for the links. See Links for more details.\n\nWorkflow maps\n\nIf you want to display a workflow map for a process, you can do so by adding some properties in your frontmatter. The workflow map helps guide users through a process. Both simple and complex workflow maps are available. For more details, see Workflow maps.\n\nUpgrading\n\nIf you want to upgrade from an earlier version of the theme, I recommend that you download the new theme and copy of your Markdown files into the new theme. You’ll then need to make adjustments to your page frontmatter, to the sidebar table of contents, links, image references, and alert references. In short, there’s no easy upgrade path. But all of this won’t take too long if you don’t have mountains of content."

					"mydoc-search-configuration-html": {
						"id": "mydoc-search-configuration-html",
						"title": "Search configuration",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /mydoc_search_configuration.html",
						"content": "About search\nThe search is configured through the search.json file in the root directory. The search is a simple search that looks at content in pages. It looks at titles, summaries, keywords, and tags.\n\nHowever, the search doesn’t work like google — you can’t hit return and see a list of results on the search results page, with the keywords in bold. Instead, this search shows a list of page titles that contain keyword matches. It’s fast, but simple.\n\nExcluding pages from search\n\nBy default, every page is included in the search. Depending on the type of content you’re including, you may find that some pages will break the JSON formatting. If that happens, then the search will no longer work.\n\nIf you want to exclude a page from search add search: exclude in the page’s frontmatter.\n\nTroubleshooting search\n\nYou should exclude any files from search that you don’t want appearing in the search results. For example, if you have a tooltips.json file or prince-list.txt, don’t include it, as the formatting will break the JSON format.\n\nIf any formatting in the search.json file is invalid (in the build), search won’t work. You’ll know that search isn’t working if no results appear when you start typing in the search box.\n\nIf this happens, point your browser to your build’s search.json file at http://localhost:4000/search.json (or your public github pages site), copy the entire search.json page as it’s output on the browser, and then use a JSON validator to validate the output by pasting what you copied into the validator. Look for the line causing trouble.  It will be highlighted. Edit the file that’s causing the problem to either exclude it from the search or fix the syntax so that it doesn’t invalidate the JSON. (Note that tabs in the body will invalidate JSON, as will certain characters in the file’s front matter.  For example, the summary: cannot have “ quotes in it.\n\nThe search.json file already tries to strip out content that would otherwise make the JSON invalid.\n\nIncluding the body field in search\n\nI’ve found that including the body field in the search creates too many problems, and so I’ve removed body from the search. You can see the results of including the body by adding this along with the other fields in search.json:\n\n      \"body\": \"{{ page.content | strip_html | strip_newlines | replace: '\\', '\\\\\\\\' | replace: '\"', '\\\\\"' | replace: '\t', '    '  }}\",\n\n\nNote that the last replace, | replace: '^t', '    ' , looks for any tab character and replaces it with four spaces. (Tab characters invalidate JSON.) If you run into other problematic formatting, you can use regex expressions to find and replace the content. See Regular Expressions for details on finding and replacing code.\n\nIt’s possible that the formatting may not account for all the scenarios that would invalidate the JSON. (Sometimes it’s an extra comma after the last item that makes it invalid.)\n\nNote that including the body in the search creates other problems as well. The search results show the most immediate matches in the JSON file. If several topics have matches for the keyword in the body, these matches might appear before other files that have matches in the title, summary, or keywords. This is because this simple search does not provide any weighting mechanisms for the content.\n\nCustomizing search results\n\nAt some point, you may want to customize the search results more. Here’s a little more detail that will be helpful. The search.json file retrieves various page values:\n\n---\ntitle: search\nlayout: none\nsearch: exclude\n---\n\n[\n{% for page in site.pages %}\n{% unless page.search == \"exclude\" %}\n{\n\"title\": \"{{ page.title | escape }}\",\n\"tags\": \"{{ page.tags }}\",\n\"keywords\": \"{{page.keywords}}\",\n\"url\": \"{{ page.url | remove: \"/\"}}\",\n\"summary\": \"{{page.summary | strip }}\"\n},\n{% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n\n{\n\"title\": \"{{ post.title | escape }}\",\n\"tags\": \"{{ post.tags }}\",\n\"keywords\": \"{{post.keywords}}\",\n\"url\": \"{{ post.url }}\",\n\"summary\": \"{{post.summary | strip }}\"\n}\n{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n]\n\n\n\nThe _includes/topnav.html file then makes use of these values:\n\n&lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;!--start search--&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"search-demo-container\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"search-input\" placeholder=\"search...\"&gt;\n        &lt;ul id=\"results-container\"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"js/jekyll-search.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n            SimpleJekyllSearch.init({\n                searchInput: document.getElementById('search-input'),\n                resultsContainer: document.getElementById('results-container'),\n                dataSource: 'search.json',\n                searchResultTemplate: '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{url}\" title=\"Search configuration\"&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;',\n    noResultsText: 'No results found.',\n            limit: 10,\n            fuzzy: true,\n    })\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;!--end search--&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n\n\nWhere you see {url} and {title}, the search is retrieving the values for these as specified in the search.json file.\n\nMore robust search\n\nOverall, the built-in search only works for small documentation projects. If you have more robust search needs, consider integrating Google Custom Search, Algolia, or Swifttype."

						"content": "Using series for pages\n\nYou create a series by looking for all pages within a tag namespace that contain certain frontmatter. Here’s a demo.\n\n1. Create the series button\n\nFirst create an include that contains your series button:\n\n&lt;div class=\"seriesContext\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"btn-group\"&gt;\n        &lt;button type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" class=\"btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle\"&gt;Series Demo &lt;span class=\"caret\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;ol class=\"dropdown-menu\"&gt;\n            {% assign pages = site.pages | sort:\"weight\"  %}\n            {% for p in pages %}\n            {% if p.series == \"ACME series\" %}\n            {% if p.url == page.url %}\n            &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt; → {{p.weight}}. {{p.title}}&lt;/li&gt;\n            {% else %}\n            &lt;li&gt;\n                &lt;a href=\"{{p.url | remove: \"/\"}}\"&gt;{{p.weight}}. {{p.title}}&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            {% endif %}\n            {% endif %}\n            {% endfor %}\n        &lt;/ol&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nChange “ACME series” to the name of your series.\n\nSave this in your _includes/custom folder as something like series_acme.html.\n\n Warning: With pages, there isn’t a universal namespace created from tags or categories like there is with Jekyll posts. As a result, you have to loop through all pages. If you have a lot of pages in your site (e.g., 1,000+), then this looping will create a slow build time. If this is the case, you will need to rethink the approach to looping here.\n\n2. Create the “next” include\n\nNow create another include for the Next button at the bottom of the page. Copy the following code, changing the series name to your series’name:\n\n&lt;p&gt;{% assign series_pages = site.tags.series_acme %}\n    {% for p in pages %}\n    {% if p.series == \"ACME series\" %}\n    {% assign nextTopic = page.weight | plus: \"1\"  %}\n    {% if p.weight == nextTopic  %}\n    &lt;a href=\"{{p.url}}\"&gt;&lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\"&gt;Next: {{p.weight}}  {{p.title}}&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    {% endif %}\n    {% endif %}\n    {% endfor %}\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\nChange “acme” to the name of your series.\n\nSave this in your _includes/custom/mydoc folder as series_acme_next.html.\n\n3. Add the correct frontmatter to each of your series pages\n\nNow add the following frontmatter to each page in the series:\n\nseries: \"ACME series\"\nweight: 1.0\n\n\nWith weights, Jekyll will treat 10 as coming after 1. If you have more than 10 items, consider changing plus: \"1.0\" to plus: \"0.1\".\n\nAdditionally, if your page names are prefaced with numbers, such as “1. Download the code,” then the {{p.weight}} will create a duplicate number. In that case, just remove the {{p.weight}} from both code samples here.\n\n4. Add links to the series button and next button on each page.\n\nOn each series page, add a link to the series button at the top and a link to the next button at the bottom.\n\n&lt;!-- your frontmatter goes here --&gt;\n\n{% include custom/series_acme.html %}\n\n&lt;!-- your page content goes here ... --&gt;\n\n{% include custom/series_acme_next.html %}\n\n\nChanging the series drop-down color\n\nThe Bootstrap menu uses the primary class for styling. If you change this class in your theme, the Bootstrap menu should automatically change color as well. You can also just use another Bootstrap class in your button code. Instead of btn-primary, use btn-info or btn-warning. See Labels for more Bootstrap button classes.\n\nUsing a collection with your series\n\nInstead of copying and pasting the button includes on each of your series, you could also create a collection and define a layout for the collection that has the include code. For more information on creating collections, see Collections for more details."

						"id": "mydoc-sidebar-navigation-html",
						"title": "Sidebar Navigation",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /mydoc_sidebar_navigation.html",
						"content": "Navgoco foundation\n\nThe sidebar uses the Navgoco jQuery plugin as its basis. Why not use Bootstrap? Navgoco provides a few features that I couldn’t find in Bootstrap:\n\n\n  Navgoco sets a cookie to remember the user’s position in the sidebar. If you refresh the page, the cookie allows the plugin to remember the state.\n  Navgoco inserts an active class based on the navigation option that’s open. This is essential for keeping the accordion open.\n  Navgoco includes the expand and collapse features of a sidebar.\n\n\nIn short, the sidebar has some complex logic here. I’ve integrated Navgoco’s features with the sidebar.html and sidebar data files to build the sidebar. It’s probably the most impressive part of this theme. (Other themes usually aren’t focused on creating hierarchies of pages, but this kind of hierarchy is important in a documentation site.)\n\nAccordion sidebar feature\n\nThe sidebar.html file (inside the _includes folder) contains the .navgoco method called on the #mysidebar element.\n\nThere are some options to set within the .navgoco method. The only noteworthy option is accordion. This option makes it so when you expand a section, the other sections collapse. It’s a way of keeping your navigation controls condensed.\n\nThe value for accordion is a Boolean (true or false). By default, the accordion option is set as true. If you don’t want the accordion, set it to false. Note that there’s also a block of code near the bottom of sidebar.html that is commented out. Uncomment out that section to have the Collapse all and Expand All buttons appear.\n\nThere’s a danger with setting the accordion to false. If you click Expand All and the sidebar expands beyond the dimensions of the browser, users will be stuck. When that happens, it’s hard to collapse it. As a best practice, leave the sidebar’s accordion option set to true.\n\nFixed position sidebar\n\nThe sidebar has one other feature — this one from Bootstrap. If the user’s viewport is tall enough, the sidebar remains fixed on the page. This allows the user to scroll down the page and still keep the sidebar in view.\n\nIn the customsscripts.js file in the js folder, there’s a function that adds an affix class if the height of the browser window is greater than 800 pixels. If the browser’s height is less than 800 pixels, the nav affix class does not get inserted. As a result, the sidebar can slide up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.\n\nDepending on your content, you may need to adjust 800 pixel number. If your sidebar is so long that having it in a fixed position makes it so the bottom of the sidebar gets cut off, increase the 800 pixel number here to a higher number.\n\nOpening sidebar links into external pages\n\nIn the attributes for each sidebar item, if you use external_url instead of url, the theme will insert the link into an a href element that opens in a blank target.\n\nFor example, the sidebar.html file contains the following code:\n\n{% if folderitem.external_url %}\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{folderitem.external_url}}\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;{{folderitem.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n\nYou can see that the external_url is a condition that applies a different formatting. Although this feature is available, I recommend putting any external navigation links in the top navigation bar instead of the side navigation bar.\n\nSidebar item highlighting\n\nThe sidebar.html file inserts an active class into the sidebar element when the url attribute in the sidebar data file matches the page URL.\n\nFor example, the sidebar.html file contains the following code:\n\n{% elsif page.url == folderitem.url %}\n   &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{folderitem.url | remove: \"/\"}}\"&gt;{{folderitem.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n\nIf the page.url matches the subfolderitem.url, then an active class gets applied. If not, the active class does not get applied.\n\nThe page.url in Jekyll is a site-wide variable. If you insert {{page.url}} on a page, it will render as follows: /mydoc_sidebar_navigation.html. The url attribute in the sidebar item must match the page URL in order to get the active class applied.\n\nThis is why the url value in the sidebar data file looks something like this:\n\n    - title: Understanding how the sidebar works\n      permalink: mydoc_understand_sidebar.html\n      output: web, pdf\n\n\nNote that the url does not include the project folder where the file is stored. This is because the site uses permalinks, which pulls the topics out of subfolders and places them into the root directory when the site builds.\n\nNow the page.url and the item.url can match and the active class can get applied. With the active class applied, the sidebar section remains open."

						"content": "Before you get into exploring Jekyll as a potential platform for help content, you may be wondering if it supports some basic features needed to fulfill your tech doc requirements. The following table shows what is supported in Jekyll and this theme.\n\nSupported features\n\n\n  \n    \n      Features\n      Supported\n      Notes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Content re-use\n      Yes\n      Supports re-use through Liquid. You can re-use variables, snippets of code, entire pages, and more. In DITA speak, this includes conref and keyref. See Content reuse for more details.\n    \n    \n      Markdown\n      Yes\n      You can author content using Markdown syntax, specifically kramdown. This is a wiki-like syntax for HTML that you can probably pick up in 10 minutes. Where Markdown falls short, you can use HTML. Where HTML falls short, you use Liquid, which is a scripting that allows you to incorporate more advanced logic.\n    \n    \n      Responsive design\n      Yes\n      Uses Bootstrap framework for responsive design.\n    \n    \n      Translation\n      Yes\n      To translate content, send the generated HTML to your translation group. You can translate the Markdown source if your translator accepts the format, but usually Markdown is problematic. Note that this theme isn’t structured well to accommodate translation projects.\n    \n    \n      Collaboration\n      Yes\n      You collaborate with Jekyll projects the same way that developers collaborate with software projects. (You don’t need a CMS.) Because you’re working with text file formats, you can use any version control software (Git, Mercurial, Perforce, Bitbucket, etc.) as a CMS for your files.\n    \n    \n      Scalability\n      Yes\n      Your site can scale to any size. It’s up to you to determine how you will design the information architecture for your pages. You can choose what you display at first, second, third, fourth, and more levels, etc. Note that when your project has thousands of pages, the build time will be longer (maybe 1 minute per thousand pages?). It really depends on how many for loops you have iterating through the pages. I recommend that you use smaller repos in your content architecture.\n    \n    \n      Lightweight architecture\n      Yes\n      You don’t need a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) architecture to get your site running. All of the building is done on your own machine, and you then push the static HTML files onto a server.\n    \n    \n      Skinnability\n      Yes\n      You can skin your Jekyll site to look identical to pretty much any other site online. If you have a UX team, they can really skin and design the site using all the tools familiar to the modern designer – JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, jQuery, and more. Jekyll is built on the modern web development stack rather than the XML stack (XSLT, XPath, XQuery). See this tutorial for details on how to create your own Jekyll theme.\n    \n    \n      Support\n      Yes\n      The community for your Jekyll site isn’t so much other tech writers (as is the case with DITA) but rather the wider web development community. Jekyll Talk is a great resource. So is Stack Overflow. See the Getting Help section of Jekyll.\n    \n    \n      Blogging features\n      Yes\n      There is a simple blogging feature. This appears as news and is intended to promote news that applies across products.\n    \n    \n      Versioning\n      Yes\n      Jekyll doesn’t version your files. You upload your files to a version control system such as Github. Your files are versioned there.\n    \n    \n      PC platform\n      Yes\n      Jekyll runs on Windows. Although the experience working on the command line is better on a Mac, Windows also works, especially now that Jekyll 3.0 dropped dependencies on Python, which wasn’t available by default on Windows.\n    \n    \n      jQuery plugins\n      Yes\n      You can use any jQuery plugins you and other JavaScript, CMS, or templating tools. However, note that if you use Ruby plugins, you can’t directly host the source files on Github Pages because Github Pages doesn’t allow Ruby plugins. Instead, you can just push your output to any web server. If you’re not planning to use Github Pages, there are no restrictions on any plugins of any sort. Jekyll makes it super easy to integrate every kind of plugin imaginable. This theme doesn’t actually use any plugins, so you can publish on Github if you want.\n    \n    \n      Bootstrap integration\n      Yes\n      This theme is built on Bootstrap. If you don’t know what Bootstrap is, basically this means there are hundreds of pre-built components, styles, and other elements that you can simply drop into your site. For example, the responsive quality of the site comes about from the Bootstrap code base.\n    \n    \n      Fast-loading pages\n      Yes\n      This is one of the Jekyll’s strengths. Because the files are static, they loading extremely fast, approximately 0.5 seconds per page. You can’t beat this for performance. (A typically database-driven site like WordPress averages about 2.5 + seconds loading time per page.) Because the pages are all static, it means they are also extremely secure. You won’t get hacked like you might with a WordPress site.\n    \n    \n      Themes\n      Yes\n      You can have different themes for different outputs. If you know CSS, theming both the web and print outputs is pretty easy.\n    \n    \n      Open source\n      Yes\n      This theme is entirely open source. Every piece of code is open, viewable, and editable. Note that this openness comes at a price — it’s easy to make changes that break the theme or otherwise cause errors.\n    \n    \n      Offline viewing\n      Yes\n      This theme uses relative linking throughout, so you can view the content offline and on any webserver without configuring urls and baseurls in your configuration file.\n    \n  \n\n\nFeatures not available\n\nThe following features are not available.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Features\n      Supported\n      Notes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      CMS interface\n      No\n      Unlike with WordPress, you don’t log into an interface and navigate to your files. You work with text files and preview the site dynamically in your browser. Don’t worry – this is part of the simplicy that makes Jekyll awesome. I recommend using WebStorm as your text editor.\n    \n    \n      WYSIWYG interface\n      No\n      I use WebStorm to author content, because I like working in text file formats. But you can use any Markdown editor you want (e.g., Lightpaper for Mac, Marked) to author your content.\n    \n    \n      Different outputs\n      No\n      This theme provides a single website output that contains documentation for multiple products. Unlike previous iterations of the theme, it’s not intended to support different outputs from the same content. However, you can easily set things up to do this by simply creating multiple configuration files and running different builds for each configuration file.\n    \n    \n      Robust search\n      No\n      The search feature is a simplistic JSON search. For more robust search, you should integrate Swiftype or Algolia. However, those services aren’t currently integrated into the theme.\n    \n    \n      Standardized templates\n      No\n      You can create pages with any structure you want. The theme does not enforce topic types such as a task or concept as the DITA specification does.\n    \n    \n      Integration with Swagger\n      No\n      You can link to a SwaggerUI output, but there is no built-in integration of SwaggerUI into this documentation theme.\n    \n    \n      Templates for endpoints\n      No\n      Although static site generators work well with API documentation, there aren’t any built-in templates specific to endpoints in this theme. You could construct your own, though.\n    \n    \n      eBook output\n      No\n      There isn’t an eBook output for the content."

						"url": " /mydoc_tables.html",
						"content": "Multimarkdown Tables\n\nYou can use Multimarkdown syntax for tables. The following shows a sample:\n\n| Priority apples | Second priority | Third priority |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| ambrosia | gala | red delicious |\n| pink lady | jazz | macintosh |\n| honeycrisp | granny smith | fuji |\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Priority apples\n      Second priority\n      Third priority\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      ambrosia\n      gala\n      red delicious\n    \n    \n      pink lady\n      jazz\n      macintosh\n    \n    \n      honeycrisp\n      granny smith\n      fuji\n    \n  \n\n\n Note: You can’t use block level tags (paragraphs or lists) inside Markdown tables, so if you need separate paragraphs inside a cell, use &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.\n\nHTML Tables\n\nIf you need a more sophisticated table syntax, use HTML syntax for the table. Although you’re using HTML, you can use Markdown inside the table cells by adding markdown=\"span\" as an attribute for the td tag, as shown in the following table. You can also control the column widths.\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;colgroup&gt;\n&lt;col width=\"30%\" /&gt;\n&lt;col width=\"70%\" /&gt;\n&lt;/colgroup&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr class=\"header\"&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Field&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td markdown=\"span\"&gt;First column **fields**&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td markdown=\"span\"&gt;Some descriptive text. This is a markdown link to [Google](http://google.com). Or see [some link][mydoc_tags].&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td markdown=\"span\"&gt;Second column **fields**&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td markdown=\"span\"&gt;Some more descriptive text.\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nFirst column fields\nSome descriptive text. This is a markdown link to Google. Or see some link.\n\n\nSecond column fields\nSome more descriptive text.\n\n\n\n\n\njQuery DataTables\n\nYou also have the option of using a jQuery DataTable, which gives you some additional capabilities. To use a jQuery DataTable in a page, include datatable: true in a page’s frontmatter. This tells the default layout to load the necessary CSS and javascript bits and to include a $(document).ready() function that initializes the DataTables library.\n\nYou can change the options used to initialize the DataTables library by editing the call to $('table.display').DataTable() in the default layout.  The available options for Datatables are described in the DataTable documentation, which is excellent.\n\nYou also must add a class of display to your tables.  You can change the class, but then you’ll need to change the trigger defined in the $(document).ready() function in the default layout from table.display to the class you prefer.\n\nYou can also add page-specific triggers (by copying the &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; block from the default layout into the page) and classes, which lets you use different options on different tables.\n\nIf you use an HTML table, adding class=\"display\" to the &lt;table&gt; tag is sufficient.\n\nMarkdown, however, doesn’t allow you to add classes to tables, so you’ll need to use a trick: add &lt;div class=\"datatable-begin\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; before the table and &lt;div class=\"datatable-end\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; after the table.  The default layout includes a jQuery snippet that automagically adds the display class to any table it finds between those two markers.  So you can start with this (we’ve trimmed the descriptions for display):\n\n&lt;div class=\"datatable-begin\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\nFood    | Description                           | Category | Sample type\n------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | -----------\nApples  | A small, somewhat round ...           | Fruit    | Fuji\nBananas | A long and curved, often-yellow ...   | Fruit    | Snow\nKiwis   | A small, hairy-skinned sweet ...      | Fruit    | Golden\nOranges | A spherical, orange-colored sweet ... | Fruit    | Navel\n\n&lt;div class=\"datatable-end\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nand get this:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Food\n      Description\n      Category\n      Sample type\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Apples\n      A small, somewhat round and often red-colored, crispy fruit grown on trees.\n      Fruit\n      Fuji\n    \n    \n      Bananas\n      A long and curved, often-yellow, sweet and soft fruit that grows in bunches in tropical climates.\n      Fruit\n      Snow\n    \n    \n      Kiwis\n      A small, hairy-skinned sweet fruit with green-colored insides and seeds.\n      Fruit\n      Golden\n    \n    \n      Oranges\n      A spherical, orange-colored sweet fruit commonly grown in Florida and California.\n      Fruit\n      Navel\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNotice a few features:\n\n\n  You can keyword search the table. When you type a word, the table filters to match your word.\n  You can sort the column order.\n  You can page the results so that you show only a certain number of values on the first page and then require users to click next to see more entries.\n\n\nRead more of the DataTable documentation to get a sense of the options you can configure. You should probably only use DataTables when you have long, massive tables full of information.\n\n Note:  Try to keep the columns to 3 or 4 columns only. If you add 5+ columns, your table may create horizontal scrolling with the theme. Additionally, keep the column heading titles short."

For example, the same item can belong to two different groups. You can also introduce other dimensions not used in your table of contents, such as platform-specific tags or audience-specific tags."

						"title": "Tags",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /mydoc_tags.html",
						"content": "Add a tag to a page\n\nYou can add tags to pages by adding tags in the frontmatter with values inside brackets, like this:\n\n---\ntitle: 5.0 Release Notes\npermalink: release_notes_5_0.html\ntags: [formatting, single_sourcing]\n---\n\n\nor inside an unordered list, like this:\n\n---\ntitle: 5.0 Release Notes\npermalink: release_notes_5_0.html\ntags: \n  - formatting\n  - single_sourcing\n---\n\n\nTags overview\n\n Note:  With posts, tags have a namespace that you can access with posts.tags.tagname, where tagname is the name of the tag. You can then list all posts in that tag namespace. But pages don’t off this same tag namespace, so you could actually use another key instead of tags. Nevertheless, I’m using the same tags approach for posts as with pages.\n\nTo prevent tags from getting out of control and inconsistent, first make sure the tag appears in the _data/tags.yml file. If it’s not there, the tag you add to a page won’t be read. I added this check just to make sure I’m using the same tags consistently and not adding new tags that don’t have tag archive pages.\n\n Note: In contrast to WordPress, with Jekyll to get tags on pages you have to build out the functionality for tags so that clicking a tag name shows you all pages with that tag. Tags in Jekyll are much more manual.\n\nAdditionally, you must create a tag archive page similar to the other pages named tag_{tagname}.html folder. This theme doesn’t auto-create tag archive pages.\n\nFor simplicity, make all your tags single words (connect them with hyphens if necessary).\n\nSetting up tags\n\nTags have a few components.\n\n\n  \n    In the _data/tags.yml file, add the tag names you want to allow. For example:\n\n    allowed-tags:\n  - getting_started\n  - overview\n  - formatting\n  - publishing\n  - single_sourcing\n  - special_layouts\n  - content types\n    \n  \n  \n    Create a tag archive file for each tag in your tags_doc.yml list. Name the file following the same pattern in the tags folder, like this: tag_collaboration.html.\n\n    Each tag archive file needs only this:\n\n    ---\ntitle: \"Collaboration pages\"\ntagName: collaboration\nsearch: exclude\npermalink: tag_collaboration.html\nsidebar: mydoc_sidebar\n---\n{% include taglogic.html %}\n    \n\n     Note: In the _includes/mydoc folder, there’s a taglogic.html file. This file (included in each tag archive file) has common logic for getting the tags and listing out the pages containing the tag in a table with summaries or truncated excerpts. You don’t have to do anything with the file — just leave it there because the tag archive pages reference it.\n  \n  \n    Change the title, tagName, and permalink values to be specific to the tag name you just created.\n\n    By default, the _layouts/page.html file will look for any tags on a page and insert them at the bottom of the page using this code:\n  \n\n\n&lt;div class=\"tags\"&gt;\n{% if page.tags != null %}\n&lt;b&gt;Tags: &lt;/b&gt;\n{% assign projectTags = site.data.tags.allowed-tags %}\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n{% if projectTags contains tag %}\n&lt;a href=\"{{ \"tag_\" | append: tag | append: \".html\" }}\" class=\"btn btn-default navbar-btn cursorNorm\" role=\"button\"&gt;{{page.tagName}}{{tag}}&lt;/a&gt;\n{% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n{% endif %}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nBecause this code appears on the _layouts/page.html file by default, you don’t need to do anything in your page to get the tags to appear. However, if you want to alter the placement or change the button color, you can do so within the _includes/taglogic.html file.\n\nYou can change the button color by changing the class on the button from btn-info to one of the other button classes bootstrap provides. See Labels for more options on button class names.\n\nRetrieving pages for a specific tag\n\nIf you want to retrieve pages outside of a particular tag_archive page, you could use this code:\n\nGetting started pages:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for page in site.pages %}\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n{% if tag == \"getting_started\" %}\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{page.url | remove: \"/\" }}\"&gt;{{page.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n{% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\nHere’s how that code renders:\n\nGetting started pages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the theme's author\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Ruby, Gems, Bundler, and other prerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Jekyll on Mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease notes 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease notes 6.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidebar Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to sort the pages alphabetically, you have to apply a sort filter:\n\n\nGetting started pages:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% assign sorted_pages = site.pages | sort: 'title' %}\n{% for page in sorted_pages %}\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n{% if tag == \"getting_started\" %}\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{page.url | remove: \"/\" }}\"&gt;{{page.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n{% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\nHere’s how that code renders:\n\nGetting started pages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Ruby, Gems, Bundler, and other prerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the theme's author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Jekyll on Mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease notes 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease notes 6.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidebar Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency\nAlthough the tag approach here uses for loops, these are somewhat inefficient on a large site. Most of my tech doc projects don’t have hundreds of pages (like my blog does). If your project does have hundreds of pages, this for loop approach with tags is going to slow down your build times.\n\nWithout the ability to access pages inside a universal namespace with the page type, there aren’t many workarounds here for faster looping.\n\nWith posts (instead of pages), since you can access just the posts inside posts.tag.tagname, you can be a lot more efficient with the looping.\n\nStill, if the build times are getting long (e.g., 1 or 2 minutes per build), look into reducing the number of for loops on your site.\n\nEmpty tags?\n\nIf your page shows “tags:” at the bottom without any value, it could mean a couple of things:\n\n\n  You’re using a tag that isn’t specified in your allowed tags list in your tags.yml file.\n  You have an empty tags: [] property in your frontmatter.\n\n\nIf you don’t want tags to appear at all on your page, remove the tags property from your frontmatter.\n\nRemembering the right tags\n\nSince you may have many tags and find it difficult to remember what tags are allowed, I recommend creating a template that prepopulates all your frontmatter with all possible tags. Then just remove the tags that don’t apply.\n\nSee WebStorm Text Editor for tips on creating file templates in WebStorm."

In the css folder, there are two theme files: theme-blue.css and theme-green.css. These files have the most common CSS elements extracted in their own CSS file. Just change the hex colors to the ones you want.\n\nIn the _includes/head.html file, specify the theme file you want the output to use — for example, theme_file: theme-green.css. See this line:\n\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme-green.css\" /&gt;\n\n\nTheme differences\nThe differences between the themes is fairly minimal. The main navigation bar, sidebar, buttons, and heading colors change color. That’s about it.\n\nIn a more sophisticated theming approach, you could use Sass files to generate rules based on options set in a data file, but I kept things simple here."

To fix this, edit your config file and change the port to a unique number.\n\nIf the previous server wasn’t shut down properly, you can kill the server process using these commands:\n\nps aux | grep jekyll\n\nFind the PID (for example, it  looks like “22298”).\n\nThen type kill -9 22298 where “22298” is the PID.\n\nAlternatively, type the following to stop all Jekyll servers:\n\nkill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')\n\n\nshell file not executable\n\nIf you run into permissions errors trying to run a shell script file (such as mydoc_multibuild_web.sh), you may need to change the file permissions to make the sh file executable. Browse to the directory containing the shell script and run the following:\n\nchmod +x build_writer.sh\n\n\nshell file not runnable\n\nIf you’re using a PC, rename your shell files with a .bat extension.\n\n“page 0” cross references in the PDF\n\nIf you see “page 0” cross-references in the PDF, the URL doesn’t exist. Check to make sure you actually included this page in the build.\n\nIf it’s not a page but rather a file, you need to add a noCrossRef class to the file so that your print stylesheet excludes the counter from it. Add class=\"noCrossRef\" as an attribute to the link. In the css/printstyles.css file, there is a style that should remove the counter from anchor elements with this class.\n\nThe PDF is blank\n\nCheck the prince-list.txt file in the output to see if it contains links. If not, you have something wrong with the logic in the prince-list.txt file. Check the conditions.html file in your _includes to see if the audience specified in your configuration file aligns with the buildAudience in the conditions.html file\n\nSidebar not appearing\n\nIf you build your site but the sidebar doesn’t appear, check the following:\n\nLook in your PDF config file and make sure you have a sidebar property, such as this:\n\npdf_sidebar: product2_sidebar\n\n\nMake sure each TOC item has an output property that specifies web or pdf.\n\nUnderstanding how the theme works can be helpful in troubleshooting. The _includes/sidebar.html file loops through the values in the _data/sidebar.yml file. There are if statements that check whether the conditions (as specified in the conditions.html file) are met. If the sidebar.yml item doesn’t have the right output, then it won’t get displayed in the sidebar. It would instead get skipped.\n\nSidebar isn’t collapsed\n\nIf the sidebar levels aren’t collapsed, usually your JavaScript is broken somewhere. Open the JavaScript Console and look to see where the problem is. If one script breaks, then other scripts will break too, so troubleshooting it is a little tricky.\n\nSearch isn’t working\n\nIf the search isn’t working, check the JSON validity in the search.json file in your output folder. Usually something is invalid. Identify the problematic line, fix the file, or put search: exclude in the frontmatter of the file to exclude it from search."

						"categories": "",
						"url": " /mydoc_webstorm_text_editor.html",
						"content": "About text editors and WebStorm\nThere are a variety of text editors available, but I like WebStorm the best because it groups files into projects, which makes it easy to find all instances of a text string, to do find and replace operations across the project, and more.\n\nIf you decide to use WebStorm, here are a few tips on configuring the editor.\n\nRemove unnecessary plugins\n\nBy default, WebStorm comes packaged with a lot more functionality than you probably need. You can lighten the editor by removing some of the plugins. Go to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Plugins and clear the check boxes of plugins you don’t need.\n\nSet default tab indent to 3 spaces instead of 4\n\nYou can set the way the tab works, and whether it uses spaces or a tab character. For details, see Code Style. JavaScript in WebStorm’s help.\n\nOn a Mac, go to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; Code Style &gt; Other File Types. Don’t select the “Use tab character” check box. Set 4 for the Tab size and Indent check boxes.\n\nOn Windows, go to File &gt; Settings &gt; Editor &gt; Code Style &gt; Other File Types to access the same menu.\n\nAdd the Markdown Support plugin\n\nSince you’ll be writing in Markdown, having color coding and other support for Markdown is important. Install the Markdown Support plugin by going to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Plugins and clicking Install JetBrains Plugin. Search for Markdown Support. You can also implement the Markdown Navigator plugin.\n\nEnable Soft Wraps (word wrapping)\n\nMost likely you’ll want to enable soft wraps, which wraps lines rather than extending them out forever and requiring you to scroll horizontally to see the text. To enable softwrapping, go to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; General and see the Soft Wraps section. Select the Use soft wraps in editor check box.\n\nExclude a directory\n\nWhen you’re searching for content, you don’t want to edit any file that appears in the _site directory. You can exclude a directory from Webstorm by right-clicking the directory and choosing Mark Directory As and then selecting Excluded.\n\nSet tabs to 4 spaces\n\nYou can set the default number of spaces a tab sets, including whether Webstorm uses a tab character or spaces. You want spaces, and you want to set this to default number of spaces to 4. Note that this is due to the way Kramdown handles the continuation \nof lists.\n\nTo set the indentation, see the “Tabs and Indents” topic in this Code Style. Javascript topic in Webstorm’s help.\n\nShortcuts\n\nIt can help to learn a few key shortcuts:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Command\n      Shortcuts\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Shift + Shift\n      Allows you to find a file by searching for its name.\n    \n    \n      Shift + Command + F\n      Find in whole project. (WebStorm uses the term “Find in path”.)\n    \n    \n      Shift + Command + R\n      Replace in whole project. (Again, WebStorm calls it “Replace in path.”)\n    \n    \n      Command + F\n      Find on page\n    \n    \n      Shift + R\n      Replace on page\n    \n    \n      Right-click &gt; Add to Favorites\n      Allows you to add files to a Favorites section, which expands below the list of files in the project pane.\n    \n    \n      Shift + tab\n      Applies outdenting (opposite of tabbing)\n    \n    \n      Shift + Function + F6\n      Rename a file\n    \n    \n      Command + Delete\n      Delete a file\n    \n    \n      Command + 2\n      Show Favorites pane\n    \n    \n      Shift + Option + F\n      Add to Favorites\n    \n  \n\n\n Tip:  If these shortcut keys aren't working for you, make sure you have the \"Max OS X 10.5+\" keymap selected. Go to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Keymap and select it there. \n\nFinding files\n\nWhen I want to find a file, I browse to the file in the preview site and copy the page name in the URL. Then in Webstorm I press Shift twice and paste in the file name. The search feature automatically highlights the file I want, and I press Enter.\n\nIdentifying changed files\n\nWhen you have the Git and Github integration, changed files appear in blue. This lets you know what needs to be committed to your repository.\n\nCreating file templates\n\nRather than insert the frontmatter by hand each time, it’s much faster to simply create a Jekyll template. To create a Jekyll template in WebStorm:\n\n\n  \n    Right-click a file in the list of project files, and select New &gt; Edit File Templates.\n\n    If you don’t see the Edit File Templates option, you may need to create a file template first. Go to File &gt; Default Settings &gt; Editor &gt; File and Code Templates. Create a new file template with an md extension, and then close and restart WebStorm. Then repeat this step and you will see the File Templates option appear in the right context menu.\n  \n  In the upper-left corner of the dialog box that appears, click the + button to create a new template.\n  \n    Name it something like Jekyll page. Insert the frontmatter you want, and save it.\n\n    To use the Jekyll template, when you create a new file in your WebStorm project, you can select your Jekyll file template.\n  \n\n\nDisable pair quotes\n\nBy default, each time you type ', WebStorm will pair the quote (creating two quotes). You can disable this by going to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; Smartkeys. Clear the Insert pair quotes check box."

Also, the links must be manually coded HTML like those shown, not automated Markdown links. (This is because the boxes are linked.)\n  \n  \n    Where you want the user maps to appear, add the sidebar properties shown in red below:\n\n    \n---\ntitle: Sample 1 Topic\nkeywords: sample\nsummary: \"This is just a sample topic...\"\nsidebar: product2_sidebar\npermalink: p2_sample1\nfolder: product2\nsimple_map: true\nmap_name: usermap\nbox_number: 1\n---\n\n\n    In the page.html layout, the following code gets activated when simple_map equals true:\n\n    {% if page.simple_map == true %}\n    \n&lt;script&gt;\n    $(document).ready ( function(){\n        $('.box{{page.box_number}}').addClass('active');\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n    \n{% include custom/{{page.map_name}}.html %}\n    \n{% endif %}\n    \n\n    The script adds an active class to the box number, which automatically makes the active workflow box become highlighted based on the page you’re viewing.\n\n    The map_name gets used as the name of the included file.\n  \n\n\nComplex workflow maps\n\nThe simpler user workflow allows for 5 workflow steps. If you have a more complex workflow, with multiple possible steps, branching, and more, consider using a complex workflow map. This map uses modals to show a list of instructions and links for each step.\n\n\n  \n    Create an include at _includes/custom/usermapcomplex.html, where usermapcomplex.html contains the workflow and links you want. See the usermapcomplex.html as an example. The code in that file simply implements Bootstrap modals to create the pop-up boxes. Add your custom content inside the modal body:\n\n    &lt;div class=\"modal-body\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is just dummy text ... Your first steps should be to get started. You will need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n    \n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"p2_sample6.html\"&gt;Sample 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"p2_sample7.html\"&gt;Sample 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"p2_sample8.html\"&gt;Sample 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;If you run into any of these setup issues, you must solve them before you can continue on.&lt;/p&gt;\n    \n          &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    The existing usermapcomplex.html file just has 3 workflow square modals. If you need more, duplicate the modal code. In the duplicated code, make sure you make the following values in red unique (but the same within the same modal):\n\n    \n &lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-lg modalButton3\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal3\"&gt;Publish your app&lt;/button&gt;\n       \n       &lt;div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"myModal3\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"myModalLabel\"&gt;\n \n  \n  \n    For each topic where you want the modal to appear, insert the following properties in your frontmatter:\n\n    \n---\ntitle: Sample 6 Topic\nkeywords: sample\nsummary: \"This is just a sample topic...\"\nsidebar: product2_sidebar\npermalink: p2_sample6\ncomplex_map: true\nmap_name: usermapcomplex\nbox_number: 1\ntoc: false\nfolder: product2\n---\n\n\n    When your frontmatter contains complex_map equal to true, the following code gets activated in the page layout.html file:\n\n    In the page.html layout, the following code gets activated when `map` equals `true`:\n        \n    \n    {% if page.complex_map == true %}\n    \n&lt;script&gt;\n    $(document).ready ( function(){\n        $('.modalButton{{page.box_number}}').addClass('active');\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n    \n{% include custom/{{page.map_name}}.html %}\n    \n{% endif %}\n```  ```"

						"id": "mydoc-yaml-tutorial-html",
						"title": "YAML tutorial in the context of Jekyll",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /mydoc_yaml_tutorial.html",
						"content": "Overview\nOne of the most interesting features of Jekyll is the ability to separate out data elements from formatting elements using a combination of YAML and Liquid. This setup is most common when you’re trying to create a table of contents.\n\nNot many Jekyll themes actually have a robust table of contents, which is critical when you are creating any kind of documentation or reference material that has a lot of pages.\n\nHere’s the basic approach in creating a table of contents. You store your data items in a YAML file using YAML syntax. (I’ll go over more about YAML syntax in a later section.) You then create your HTML structure in another file, such as sidebar.html. You might leverage one of the many different table of content frameworks (such as Navgoco) that have been created for this HTML structure.\n\nThen, using Liquid syntax for loops and conditions, you access all of those values from the data file and splice them into HTML formatting. This will become more clear as we go through some examples.\n\nYAML overview\n\nRather than just jump into YAML at the most advanced level, I’m going to start from ground zero with an introduction to YAML and how you access basic values in your data files using Jekyll.\n\nNote that you don’t actually have to use Jekyll when using YAML. YAML is used in a lot of other systems and is a format completely independent of Jekyll. However, because Jekyll uses Liquid, it gives you a lot of power to parse through your YAML data and make use of it.\n\nYAML itself doesn’t do anything on its own — it’s just a way of storing your data in a specific structure that other utilities can parse.\n\nYAML basics\nYou can read about YAML from a lot of different sources. Here are some basic characteristics of YAML:\n\n\n  YAML (“YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) doesn’t use markup tags. This means you won’t see any kind of angle brackets. It uses white space as a way to form the structure. This makes YAML much more human readable.\n  Because YAML does use white space for the structure, YAML is extremely picky about the exactness of spaces. If you have just one extra space somewhere, it can cause the whole file to be invalid.\n  For each new level in YAML, you indent two spaces. Each level provides a different access point for the content. You use dot notation to access each new level.\n  Because tabs are not universally implemented the same way in editors, a tab might not equate to two spaces. In general, it’s best to manually type two spaces to create a new level in YAML.\n  YAML has several types of elements. The most common are mappings and lists. A mapping is simply a key-value pair. A list is a sequence of items. List start with hyphens.\n  Items at each level can have various properties. You can create conditions based on the properties.\n  You can use “for” loops to iterate through a list.\n\n\nI realize a lot of this vague and general; however, it will become a lot more clear as we go through some concrete examples.\n\nIn the _data folder, there’s a file called samplelist.yml. All of these examples come from that file.\n\nExample 1: Simple mapping\n\nYAML:\n\nname:\n  husband: Tom\n  wife: Shannon\n\n\nMarkdown + Liquid:\n\n&lt;p&gt;Husband's name: {{site.data.samplelist.name.husband}}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wife's name: {{site.data.samplelist.name.wife}}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\nNotice that in order to access the data file, you use site.data.samplelist where as samplelist is the name of the YAML file.\n\nResult:\n\n\nHusband's name: Tom\nWife's name: Shannon\n\n\nExample 2: Line breaks\n\nYAML:\n\nfeedback: &gt;\n  This is my feedback to you.\n  Even if I include linebreaks here,\n  all of the linebreaks will be removed when the value is inserted.\n\nblock: |\n    This pipe does something a little different.\n    It preserves the breaks.\n    This is really helpful for code samples,\n    since you can format the code samples with\n       the appropriate\n\n\nMarkdown:\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feedback&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;{{site.data.samplelist.feedback}}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Block&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;{{site.data.samplelist.block}}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\nResult:\n\n\nFeedback\nThis is my feedback to you. Even if I include linebreaks here, all of the linebreaks will be removed when the value is inserted.\n\n\nBlock\nThis pipe does something a little different.\nIt preserves the breaks.\nThis is really helpful for code samples,\nsince you can format the code samples with\n   the appropriate\n   white spacing.\n\n\n\nThe right angle bracket &gt; allows you to put the value on the next lines (which must be indented). Even if you create a line break, the output will remove all of those line breaks, creating one paragraph.\n\nThe pipe | functions like the angle bracket in that it allows you to put the values for the mapping on the next lines (which again must be indented). However, the pipe does preserve all of the line breaks that you use. This makes the pipe method ideal for storing code samples.\n\nExample 3: Simple list\n\nYAML:\n\nbikes:\n  - title: mountain bikes\n  - title: road bikes\n  - title: hybrid bikes\n\n\nMarkdown + Liquid:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for item in site.data.samplelist.bikes %}\n&lt;li&gt;{{item.title}}&lt;/li&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\n\nmountain bikes\n\nroad bikes\n\nhybrid bikes\n\n\n\n\nHere we use a “for” loop to get each item in the bikes list. By using .title we only get the title property from each list item.\n\nExample 4: List items\n\nYAML:\n\nsalesteams:\n- title: Regions\n subfolderitems:\n   - location: US\n   - location: Spain\n   - location: France\n\n\nMarkdown + Liquid:\n\n{% for item in site.data.samplelist.salesteams %}\n&lt;h3&gt;{{item.title}}&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for entry in item.subfolderitems %}\n&lt;li&gt;{{entry.location}}&lt;/li&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nUS\n\nSpain\n\nFrance\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully you can start to see how to wrap more complex formatting around the YAML content. When you use a “for” loop, you choose the variable of what to call the list items. The variable you choose to use becomes how you access the properties of each list item. In this case, I decided to use the variable item. In order to get each property of the list item, I used item.subfolderitems.\n\nEach list item starts with the hyphen –.  You cannot directly access the list item by referring to a mapping. You only loop through the list items. If you wanted to access the list item, you would have to use something like [1], which is how you access the position in an array. You cannot access a list item like you can access a mapping key.\n\nExample 5: Table of contents\n\nYAML:\n\ntoc:\n  - title: Group 1\n    subfolderitems:\n      - page: Thing 1\n      - page: Thing 2\n      - page: Thing 3\n  - title: Group 2\n    subfolderitems:\n      - page: Piece 1\n      - page: Piece 2\n      - page: Piece 3\n  - title: Group 3\n    subfolderitems:\n      - page: Widget 1\n      - page: Widget 2 it's\n      - page: Widget 3\n\n\nMarkdown + Liquid:\n\n{% for item in site.data.samplelist.toc %}\n&lt;h3&gt;{{item.title}}&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for entry in item.subfolderitems %}\n&lt;li&gt;{{entry.page}}&lt;/li&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\nGroup 1\n\n\nThing 1\n\nThing 2\n\nThing 3\n\n\n\nGroup 2\n\n\nPiece 1\n\nPiece 2\n\nPiece 3\n\n\n\nGroup 3\n\n\nWidget 1\n\nWidget 2\n\nWidget 3\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example is similar to the previous one, but it’s more developed as a real table of contents.\n\nExample 6: Variables\n\nYAML:\n\nsomething: &amp;hello Greetings earthling!\nmyref: *hello\n\n\nMarkdown:\n\n{{ site.data.samplelist.myref }}\n\n\nResult:\n\n\nGreetings earthling!\n\n\nThis example is notably different. Here I’m showing how to reuse content in YAML file. If you have the same value that you want to repeat in other mappings, you can create a variable using the &amp; symbol. Then when you want to refer to that variable’s value, you use an asterisk * followed by the name of the variable.\n\nIn this case the variable is &amp;hello and its value is Greetings earthling! In order to reuse that same value, you just type *hello.\n\nI don’t use variables much, but that’s not to say they couldn’t be highly useful. For example, let’s say you put name of the product in parentheses after each title (because you have various products that you’re providing documentation for in the same site). You could create a variable for that product name so that if you change how you’re referring to it, you wouldn’t have to change all instances of it in your YAML file.\n\nExample 7: Positions in lists\n\nYAML:\n\nabout:\n - zero\n - one\n - two\n - three\n\n\nMarkdown:\n\n{{ site.data.samplelist.about[0] }}\n\n\nResult:\n\nzero\n\n\nYou can see that I’m accessing one of the items in the list using [0]. This refers to the position in the array where a list item is. Like most programming languages, you start counting at zero, not one.\n\nI wanted to include this example because it points to the challenge in getting a value from a specific list item. You can’t just call out a specific item in a list like you can with a mapping. This is why you usually iterate through the list items using a “for” loop.\n\nExample 8: Properties from list items at specific positions\n\nYAML:\n\nnumbercolors:\n - zero:\n   properties: red\n - one:\n   properties: yellow\n - two:\n   properties: green\n - three:\n   properties: blue\n\n\nMarkdown + Liquid:\n\n{{ site.data.samplelist.numbercolors[0].properties }}\n\n\nResult:\n\nred\n\n\nThis example is similar as before; however, in this case were getting a specific property from the list item in the zero position.\n\nExample 9: Conditions\n\nYAML:\n\nmypages:\n- section1: Section 1\n  audience: developers\n  product: acme\n  url: facebook.com\n- section2: Section 2\n  audience: writers\n  product: acme\n  url: google.com\n- section3: Section 3\n  audience: developers\n  product: acme\n  url: amazon.com\n- section4: Section 4\n  audience: writers\n  product: gizmo\n  url: apple.com\n- section5: Section 5\n  audience: writers\n  product: acme\n  url: microsoft.com\n\n\nMarkdown + Liquid:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for sec in site.data.samplelist.mypages %}\n{% if sec.audience == \"writers\" %}\n&lt;li&gt;{{sec.url}}&lt;/li&gt;\n{% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngoogle.com\n\n\n\n\n\napple.com\n\n\n\nmicrosoft.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example shows how you can use conditions in order to selectively get the YAML content. In your table of contents, you might have a lot of different pages. However, you might only want to get the pages for a particular audience. Conditions lets you get only the items that meet those audience attributes.\n\nNow let’s adjust the condition just a little. Let’s add a second condition so that the audience property has to be writers and the product property has to be gizmo. This is how you would write it:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for sec in site.data.samplelist.mypages %}\n{% if sec.audience == \"writers\" and sec.product == \"gizmo\" %}\n&lt;li&gt;{{sec.url}}&lt;/li&gt;\n{% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\nAnd here is the result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napple.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore resources\n\nFor more examples and explanations, see this helpful post on tournemille.com: How to create data-driven navigation in Jekyll."

Classic 환경에서는 다음 단계로 바로 이동하시면 됩니다.\n\n\n\n옵션 설정\n실행할 Main 함수의 이름을 {Assembly}::{Class Full Name}::{Method} 형태의 풀네임으로 입력합니다. \n위에서 만든 Hello.cs에서는 CloudFunctionsTestConsole::CloudFunctionsTestConsole.Hello::Main 으로 입력합니다.\n\n액션 메모리와 Timeout은 기본으로 두셔도 되고 익숙해진 이후에 상황에 맞게 조정하시면 됩니다.\n\n\n\n\n입력할 Main 함수 이름을 어떻게 적으면 되는지 한번 더 살펴보겠습니다.\n아래 소스코드 화면에서 보시면 namespace, class, Main 이렇게 이름이 적혀 있는 곳에서\n{ 1 }::{ 1 }.{ 2 }::{ 3 } 이렇게 연결해서 적으면 CloudFunctionsTestConsole::CloudFunctionsTestConsole.Hello::Main 이렇게 완성이 되고\n이 이름을 Main 함수 이름 칸에 입력하시면 됩니다.\n\n\n\n생성 완료\n디폴트 파라미터의 경우 필요하실 경우 설정하시면 됩니다.\n모든 준비가 끝났으면 생성 버튼을 클릭하여 액션을 생성합니다.\n\n\n\nCF Action 실행\n이제 생성된 액션을 실행해보겠습니다.\n액션의 기본정보 화면에서는 액션 실행과 수정, 삭제를 할 수 있고, 모니터링 화면에서는 액션이 실행된 통계 정보를 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n\n\n액션 실행화면 왼쪽에는 파라미터를 입력할 수 있고,\n오른쪽에는 결과가 나오는데 전체 결과 메시지를 확인하거나 결과만 보기 옵션으로 최종 성공 실패에 대한 결과 메시지만 볼 수도 있습니다.\n우선은 파라미터 없이 실행해 보았고, 무사히 성공한 결과가 나왔습니다.\n\n\n\n\n이번에는 파라미터를 입력하고 액션을 실행해보았습니다.  파라미터는 json 형태로 입력하면 됩니다.\n왼쪽 창에서 입력한 파라미터가 결과에 잘 반영되어 나왔습니다.\n\n\n\n\n결과만 보기 옵션을 끄고 실행하면 이렇게 스크롤 해야만 전체를 확인할 수 있을 정도로 긴 결과 메시지가 나타납니다.\n\n\n\n오류 메시지\n위의 순서대로 진행을 하면 문제 없이 사용 가능한데, 이미 다른 방법으로 진행해보면서 오류 메시지를 경험하는 경우도 있을 듯하여 가장 많이 겪게 되는 오류 상황 2가지를 정리해보겠습니다.\n\nMain 함수 이름 입력 오류\n위에서 설명한 액션 Main 함수 이름을 올바르게 입력하지 않으면 다음과 같은 오류 메시지가 나타납니다.\n\n\"error\" : \"main required format is \\\"Assembly::Type::Function\\\".\"\n\n\n\n\n\n상단에 설명한 [CF Action 생성] - [옵션 설정]에서 Main 함수 입력하는 부분을 참고하셔서 정확하게 입력하시면 문제가 해결됩니다.\n\n.Net 대상 프레임워크 오류\n네이버 클라우드 Cloud Functions은 .Net Standard 2.0 규약을 지원하고 있습니다.\n그런데 이 대상 프레임워크가 맞지 않으면 다음과 같은 오류 메시지가 나타납니다.\n\n\"error\" : \"Unable to locate requested type (\\\"CloudFunctionsTestConsole.Hello\\\").\"\n\n\n\n\n\n위 [프로젝트 생성]에서 설명한 것처럼 프로젝트 생성할 때 -f netstandard2.0 옵션을 반드시 넣어주셔어야 합니다.\n\n:: 프로젝트 생성\nD:\\&gt;dotnet new classlib -n CloudFunctionsTestConsole -lang \"C#\" -f netstandard2.0\n\n\n참고 URL\nhttps://guide.ncloud-docs.com/docs/compute-compute-15-2-6.html"

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\nMore sample content\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\nMore sample content\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\nMore sample content\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
